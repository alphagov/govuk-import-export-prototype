You must apply for a replacement certificate to re-export goods to another country that have been imported into the UK and not entered into free circulation. You can apply to either:

- HMRC Central Issuing Office
- your local Chambers of Commerce
- local offices of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

^You can’t get a replacement certificate to re-export goods to non-EU countries, if the goods have already entered free circulation.^

You must provide:

- a completed movement certificate
- the movement certificate to be replaced or details of the document and when and where it was presented to customs

If the original certificate was a GSP Form A, you must [contact your local Chambers of Commerce](http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/find-your-chamber/) to get a replacement.
