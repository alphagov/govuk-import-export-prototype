Apply for a replacement movement certificate to re-export goods within the EU if they've:

- been imported into the UK
- not entered into free circulation

You can apply to either:

- HMRC Central Issuing Office
- your local Chambers of Commerce
- local offices of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

You must provide:

- a completed [movement certificate](/guide/use-trade-preferences-import-export/use-trade-preferences-export-goods.html)
- the movement certificate to be replaced or details of the document and when and where it was presented to customs

If the original certificate was a GSP Form A, you must [contact your local Chambers of Commerce](http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/find-your-chamber/) to get a replacement.
