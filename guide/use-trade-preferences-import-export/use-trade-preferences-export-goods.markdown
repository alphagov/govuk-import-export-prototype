To export goods under trade preference, you must:

s1. Prove the origin of your goods.   
s2. Get a valid movement certificate.  
s3. Transport your goods correctly.   


##Prove the origin of your goods

You must provide proof that either:

- the goods have been wholly produced in the EU 
- the last significant stage of their manufacture took place in the EU

Read [guidance on rules of origin](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-828-tariff-preferences-rules-of-origin-for-various-countries/notice-828-tariff-preferences-rules-of-origin-for-various-countries#origin-conditions) to find out if your goods qualify. 

[Question for SME: what kind of evidence do I need to provide if goods have been wholly produced in the EU?]

Contact the Customs helpline if you’re unsure if your goods qualify.

###Goods not wholly produced in the EU 

You may need to get a ‘suppliers’ declaration’ to prove that the materials used in the manufacture originate from the EU. For example if:

- the materials don’t change tariff heading after manufacture has taken place
- your goods exceed the limit for non-originating materials (if your goods exceed the limit by 5%, you’ll need a supplier declaration to cover the value of the materials in excess of the limit
- you manufacture using materials at a later stage of production than that specified
- you buy and export goods in the same state

^If you regularly export identical goods, you can [apply for Binding Origin Information (BOI)](/guide/use-trade-preferences-import-export/get-binding-origin-information.html) to confirm the origin of your goods.^

You must ask your supplier to provide a written declaration. If you’re the supplier, you’ll need to do this yourself. 

###Make a suppliers' declaration

The suppliers’ declaration must include:

- a list of the goods concerned and confirmation that they originate in the EU
- name of the company being supplied
- whether the goods satisfy the rules of origin for the country you’re trading with
- whether cumulation has been applied, if you’re trading with the Pan-Euro-Med zone
- details of components or materials that don’t originate in the EU, including their country of origin and customs value (if required)
- a description of the processing that has taken place within the EU
- dates of further shipments (this must not exceed 12 months) 
- a statement that supporting documents are available for inspection
- confirmation that the company being supplied will be notified if any of the goods lose their EU origin
- place and date
- signature
- name of signatory in capital letters and their position in the company

The declaration can be written on the invoices for the goods supplied, or on any other commercial document that fully identifies the goods. If the goods are supplied regularly or over a long period, the declaration must be written on company headed paper.

^You must keep proof of origin, such as full bills or supplier declarations, for at least 3 years.^

##Get a movement certificate

You must provide a movement certificate. The type of preference certificate you need depends on the trade agreement in place. Check the [Trade Tariff](/link) to find out which trade agreement is in place with the country you’re trading with. 

Trade agreement | Preference certificate
-|-
Pan-Euro-Med cumulation | EUR-MED movement certificate
All other preference countries | EUR1 movement certificate
Re-export goods imported from the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) | Form A
