Importers and exporters can apply for Binding Origin Information (BOI) to get legal confirmation of the origin of your goods. 
This can help to speed up regular shipments of identical goods through customs. 

It’s valid for 3 years and legally recognised across the EU.

##Advantages of BOI

BOI can:

- reduce the chance of local customs challenging the origin of the goods while in transit, if your goods move within the EU before they reach their destination
- stop you from having to prove the origin of the goods repeatedly during trading, if the origin of your goods isn’t straightforward
- allow you to continue to fulfill existing contracts for up to 6 months, if any change in EU law makes your BOI invalid

You must be able to prove, if asked, that the goods are identical to the goods in the BOI, including how they were manufactured.

^You’ll still need to provide a movement certificate.^ 

##Apply for BOI

You must make a separate application for each BOI you want - each application only covers one product. But it will cover subsequent consignments of identical goods. 

Complete [Application for Binding Origin Information.](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/CE1900&template=CE1900.xdp).

HMRC let you know if your application has been successful within 45 days.

^You can’t use a BOI decision for goods that have already been imported or exported.^
