If you’re a regular exporter, you can apply to become an approved exporter. This means you can provide a simplified ‘invoice declaration’ instead of a preference certificate. 

An invoice declaration doesn’t have to be stamped or signed or approved by a government authority and can be given on:

- the commercial invoice
- packing list
- consignment note
- other commercial document

##Eligibility

You may be eligible if:

- you import or export goods on a regular basis
- the goods satisfy the relevant origin rules

##Apply to be an approved exporter

Complete the [Application for approved exporter status](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs/1.0/C1454&template=C1454.xdp) and send it to: 

$A
HMRC Authorisation and Returns Team 
Peter Bennett House

##Making invoice declarations

When you’re approved, you’ll be given an authorisation number and will be told how to make an invoice declaration. 

##Get help

You can call the HMRC VAT helpline for further information.

If you are taking your first steps as an importer or exporter be aware that you have to be registered as such. See Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) Scheme.
