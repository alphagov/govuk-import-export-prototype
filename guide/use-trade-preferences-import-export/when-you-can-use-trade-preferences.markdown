You can pay less or no duty when you import or export goods, if there's a trade preference agreement in place.

This is known as importing or exporting 'under preference'. 

Check the [Trade Tariff](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/start/trade-tariff.html) to find out if there’s a trade preference agreement with the country you’re trading with. 

Contact the [Tariff Classification Service](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tariff-classification-service) if you’re unsure how to classify your goods.
