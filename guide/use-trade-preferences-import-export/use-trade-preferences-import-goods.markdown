To use import goods under trade preference, you must:

s1. Prove the origin of your goods.   
s2. Get a movement certificate.   
s3. Transport your goods correctly.   


##Prove the origin of your goods

You must prove the goods have ‘originated’ from the country with the trade preference agreement. This means either:

- the goods must have been produced in that country  
- the last significant stage of their manufacture took place in that country  

You can either:

- ask your overseas supplier or selling agent for written confirmation the goods originate from that country 
- [get Binding Origin Information (BOI)](/guide/use-trade-preferences-import-export/get-binding-origin-information.html) for your goods

[Question for SME: what do I have to do with this? just keep it for records?] 

Call the Customs helpline if you’re still unsure your goods qualify.

##Get a movement certificate

Your exporter must provide a movement certificate to accompany the goods. 

They must get the certificate stamped and signed by the relevant government authority in the exporting country. 

##Transporting your goods

Your goods must be transported directly from the country they’re exported from. The goods can only pass through another country if they:

- don’t enter into [free circulation](link) in that country
- don’t undergo any operation there other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to keep them in good condition
- are temporarily stored there for transport reasons

###Exceptions

You can transport goods through certain groups of preference countries. Each of the following groups of preference countries is treated as a single separate preference area for the purpose of the transport rule:  

- Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
- the ACP States and the OCTs
- Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia (the Maghreb countries)
- the countries of the Pan Euro-MED cumulation zone
- Brunei Darussalam, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam (Group 1)
- Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela (Group 2)
- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Group 3)
- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay. Uruguay

**Example** You can import goods from Argentina via Uruguay, Brazil or Paraguay and they’ll still be regarded as having been transport directly.

###Records you must keep

You must provide a through bill of lading, if the goods were transported directly from the country of origin.

If you transport the goods via another country, you must provide:

- a through bill of lading, for goods by sea
- a through air way bill, for goods by air
- a copy of the International Carriage of Goods by road document or a Transports Internationaux Routiers carnet
- a copy of the International Consignment Note indicating a single contract for the carriage of the consignment from the preference receiving country or country group in the EU

##Belated claims

You can get a duty repayment if you claim preference after you import the goods. You'll still need to prove the origin of the goods and get a movement certificate. 

Complete an [application for repayment](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/C285&template=C285.xdp) and send it to The National Duty Repayment Centre.
