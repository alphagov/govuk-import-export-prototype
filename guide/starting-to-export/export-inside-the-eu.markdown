You may need to [get a licence](/starting-to-export/export-licences) to export certain goods within the EU.

You don’t usually have to pay duty and there are no customs checks within the EU.

You don’t usually need to make an export declaration to send goods to another [EU country](/eu-eea). But you’ll need to make a [community transit declaration](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials brought in from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid on them.

You must [make an Intrastat declaration](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you export goods worth over £250,000.

You’ll need to provide details of your exports on your [VAT return](/vat-returns).
