You may need to get a licence to export [certain goods](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) within the EU.

You’ll need to provide details of your exports on your [VAT return](/vat-returns) if you're registered for VAT.

##Declarations

You don’t usually need to make an export declaration to send goods to another [EU or EEA country](/eu-eea). 

You must make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid.

You must [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you export goods worth over £250,000.
