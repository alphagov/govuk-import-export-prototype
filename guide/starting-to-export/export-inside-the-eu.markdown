You may need to [get a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to export certain goods within the EU.

You don’t usually need to make an export declaration to send goods to another [EU or EEA country](/eu-eea). But you’ll need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials brought in from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid on them.

You must [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you export goods worth over £250,000.

You’ll need to provide details of your exports on your [VAT return](/vat-returns).
