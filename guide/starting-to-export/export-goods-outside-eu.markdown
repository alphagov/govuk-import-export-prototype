There are more tasks to complete to export outside the EU. You may also need to pay import duty in the country you're exporting to.

s1. Check the import rules of the country youâ€™re exporting to. Talk to your importer or read the appropriate [country guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides).
s2. [Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to export restricted goods outside the UK. 
s3. [Find your goods' commodity code](/start/trade-tariff.html) - you'll need this for your commercial invoice. The code affects any import duty that will be charged.
s4. Register for an EORI number, if you don't have one. How you apply depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport) It usually takes 3 working days. Tell your freight forwarder the number when you get it.
s5. Your freight forwarder will ask you to complete a commercial invoice. When filling in the value of your goods, use the price you sold them for (listing separately any freight or export insurance you included in the price).
s6. Attach the commercial invoice (and licence, if you need one) to your consignment.

Your freight forwarder will use your commercial invoice to make an official customs declaration. Your goods can be held up in customs if the information you give isn't accurate.

##After you export

You must keep records of commercial invoices and any customs paperwork for 4 years.

Pay any tax or duty you owe in the destination country. You won't usually pay UK duty on exports.

If you're VAT registered, you can [zero-rate](http://www.gov.uk/vat-businesses/vat-rates) the VAT on most goods you export to non-EU countries.

###If you export regularly outside the EU

You can get help keeping records of customs declarations, for example if you're a large business using different warehouses or freight forwarders.

If you need to, you can order [reports of customs declarations](/order-customs-declaration-reports.html) made by your freight forwarder.
