What you need to do to export from the UK depends on whether youâ€™re exporting:

- [inside the EU](/starting-to-export/inside-the-eu)
- [outside the EU](/starting-to-export/outside-the-eu)

There are different processes if you either:

- [send goods abroad](/send-goods-abroad) on a one-off or irregular basis - eg after selling goods on an online auction site
- [take goods out of the UK temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html) - eg to a trade fair

##Export advice and finance

You can get help [choosing where to export](/start/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

You may be able to get [export insurance or finance](/export-insurance-export-finance.html) to:

- protect you against the risk of not getting paid  
- help finance an export deal your bank can't do on their own
