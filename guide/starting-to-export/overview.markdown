What you need to do to export goods from the UK depends on whether youâ€™re exporting:

- [inside the EU](/guide/starting-to-export/move-goods-inside-the-eu.html)
- [outside the EU](/guide/starting-to-export/export-outside-the-eu.html)

^If you're providing services abroad, [check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html).

There are different processes if you either:

- [post small, low value goods abroad](https://www.gov.uk/send-goods-abroad) - for example, after selling goods on an online auction site or your business gets an order from abroad
- [take goods out of the UK temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html) - for example, taking laptops to a trade fair

##Export advice and finance

You can get help [choosing where to export](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

You may be able to get [export insurance or finance](/export-insurance-export-finance.html) to:

- protect you against the risk of not getting paid  
- help finance an export deal your bank can't do on their own
