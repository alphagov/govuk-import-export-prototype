What you need to do to export from the UK depends on whether you’re exporting:

- [inside the EU](/starting-to-export/inside-the-eu)
- [outside the EU](/starting-to-export/outside-the-eu)

There’s a different process if you [send goods outside the EU by post](/send-goods-abroad) or [take goods out of the UK temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html).

##Export advice and finance

You can get help [choosing an export market](/start/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

You may be able to get [export insurance or export finance](/export-insurance-export-finance.html) to:

- protect you against the risk or getting paid  
- help  finance an export deal your bank can't finance on their own
