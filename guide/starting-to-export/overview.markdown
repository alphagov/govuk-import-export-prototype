What you need to do to export from the UK depends on whether you’re exporting:

- [inside the EU](/starting-to-export/inside-the-eu)
- [outside the EU](/starting-to-export/outside-the-eu)

There’s a different process if you [send goods outside the EU by post](/send-goods-abroad) or [take goods out of the UK temporarily](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html).

##Export advice and finance

Starting to export can be complicated and you may want some help.

You can get help [choosing an export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/start/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

[Export insurance](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/export-insurance-export-finance.html) can help provide insurance against not getting paid when you export goods.
