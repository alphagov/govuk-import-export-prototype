You can [post goods abroad](/send-goods-abroad) if your business gets small orders from overseas.

For bigger orders, most businesses use a freight forwarder or courier.

Follow the process for [exporting using an freight forwarder] to make sure:

- your goods aren't held up in customs
- you pay the right amount of any import duty if you export to a non-EU country
- you've got permission to export any restricted goods

##Export advice and finance

You can get help [choosing where to export](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

You may be able to get [export insurance or finance](/export-insurance-export-finance.html) to:

- protect you against the risk of not getting paid  
- help finance an export deal your bank can't do on their own  

##Doing other types of business abroad

You may need permission to provide services in higher risk industries or countries.  [Check if you need a licence](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html).

If you take goods out of the UK yourself, what you need to do depends on whether you're:

- [selling them abroad]
- [taking them abroad temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html) (for example taking laptops to a trade fair)
