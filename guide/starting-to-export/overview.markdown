You can post goods abroad if your business gets small orders from overseas.

For bigger orders, most businesses use a courier or freight forwarder.

What you need to do depends on whether you're exporting:

- [within the EU](/guide/starting-to-export/goods-within-eu.html)
- [outside the EU](/guide/starting-to-export/goods-outside-eu.html)

^Thereâ€™s a different process if you [take goods with you](/take-merchandise-in-baggage.html) (for example in your baggage), or [your company transports the goods itself](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/declarations-and-the-single-administrative-document) - you may need to complete customs form C88.

##Export advice and finance

You can get help [choosing where to export](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).

You may be able to get [export insurance or finance](/export-insurance-export-finance.html) to:

- protect you against the risk of not getting paid  
- help finance an export deal your bank can't do on their own  

##Doing other types of business abroad

Follow the rules for tax if you [sell digital services in the EU](https://www.gov.uk/vat-registration/registering-vat-other-eu-countries), for example downloadable video, music, ebooks or software.

You may need permission to:

- [provide services in higher risk industries or countries](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html)
- [take goods abroad temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html), for example samples for a trade fair
