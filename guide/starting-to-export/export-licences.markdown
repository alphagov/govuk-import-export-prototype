You may need a licence before you can export some types of goods. These are called ‘restricted goods’.

## Special rules for high-tech products

Some goods, technologies and information that you might not think need a licence may also have military use (called dual use items). 

This applies if you're exporting:

- [arms, military or 'dual use' goods and services](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html)
- [law enforcement and torture goods](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-law-enforcement-and-torture-goods.html)
- [radioactive substances](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-radioactive-substances.html)

 Dual use items are usually high-tech, often with military standard specifications. They include:

- specialist computers, radios and other communications equipment
- information (eg manuals, blueprints) that could be used to make weapons, as well as civilian goods
- software that could be used for information security systems (eg cryptographic technology)
- knowledge and skills that could be used for military purposes


%It’s a criminal offence to export dual use items without a licence.
