You must get a licence to move [certain goods](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) within the EU.

You'll need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid.

##After you export

You must [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you move goods worth over £250,000.

You'll need to provide details of the goods on your [VAT return](/vat-returns) if you're registered for VAT.
