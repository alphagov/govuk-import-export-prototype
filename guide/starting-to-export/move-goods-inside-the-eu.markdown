You need to complete 4 main tasks to move goods within the [EU](/eu-eea).

s1. Choose an freight forwarder or courier to move your goods to their destination.
s2. [Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to export restricted goods like high-tech products, chemicals or weapons. 
s3. Your freight forwarder will ask you to complete a commercial invoice. 
s4. Attach the commercial invoice (and licence, if you need one) to your consignment.


##Outside the EU

There are additional tasks to complete to export outside the EU. You may also need to pay import duty in the country you're exporting to.

s1. Register for an EORI number, if you don't have one. How you apply depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport) It usually takes 3 working days. Tell your freight forwarder the number when you get it.
s2. Check what commodity code describes your goods using the [Trade Tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html). The code affects any import duty that will be charged.
s3. Include the commodity code in your commercial invoice. Your freight forwarder will use your commercial invoice to make an official customs declaration, which you have legal responsibility for.


##After you export

You must keep records of commercial invoices and any customs paperwork for 4 years.

You may also have to do other things, depending on where you exported.

###Within the EU

If you're VAT registered, you must [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you move goods within the EU worth over Â£250,000.

Also provide details of the goods on your [VAT return](/vat-returns). {do we need to say this? If we do, does this only apply for goods within the EU?}

###Outside the EU

Pay any tax or duty you owe  in the destination country. You won't usually pay UK duty on exports.

If you're VAT registered, you can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates) the VAT on most goods you export to non-EU countries.

###If you export regularly outside the EU

You can get help keeping records of customs declarations, for example if you're a large business using different warehouses or freight forwarders.

If you need to, you can order [reports of customs declarations] made by your freight forwarder.
