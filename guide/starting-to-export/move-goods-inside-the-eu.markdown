You only need a licence for certain goods within the EU.

Check the list to confirm if your goods need a licence or special documents :

^If you don't get a licence when you need one, you could be fined and your goods will be seized by customs.^

You'll only need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid.

##After you export

You must either:

- [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you move goods worth over £250,000 (if you’re VAT registered)

- Provide details of the goods on your [VAT return](/vat-returns) if you're registered for VAT.
