You need to complete certain tasks to move goods within the [EU](/eu-eea).

s1. Check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or read the appropriate [country guide].
s2. [Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to export restricted goods from the UK.
s3. Your courier or freight forwarder will ask you to complete a proforma invoice. 
s4. Attach the proforma invoice (and licence, if you need one) to your consignment.


##After you export

You must keep records of proforma invoices and any customs paperwork for 4 years.

If you're VAT registered, you must [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you move goods within the EU worth over £250,000.
