You need to complete certain tasks to move goods within the [EU](/eu-eea).

s1. [Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) or to follow special rules to export restricted goods from the UK.
s2. Your courier or freight forwarder will ask you to complete a proforma invoice. 
s3. Attach the proforma invoice (and licence, if you need one) to your consignment.

^Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or reading the [country guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides), which includes contact details for local advice.

##After you export

You must keep records of proforma invoices and any customs paperwork for 4 years.

If you’re VAT registered and in any month move goods worth over £250,000 within the EU, [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html).
