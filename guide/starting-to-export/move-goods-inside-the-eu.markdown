You only need a licence for certain goods within the EU.

[Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) or special documents to move your goods within the EU.

%If you don't get a licence when you need one, you could be fined and your goods will be seized by customs.%

You'll only need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if your goods were made from materials from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid.

##After you export

If you're VAT registered, you must both:

- [make an Intrastat declaration](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) for any month when you move goods worth over £250,000

- provide details of the goods on your [VAT return](/vat-returns)
