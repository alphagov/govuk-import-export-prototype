s1. Check if you need a [licence to export your goods](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) outside the EU and how long it will take to get one. 
s2. Make an [export declaration](/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/overview.html) to export goods to a country outside the EU. 

^If you don't get a licence when you need one, you could be fined and your goods  will be seized by customs.

Use the [Trade Tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html) to check what commodity code you need on your export declaration.

##After you export

You won't usually pay UK duty on exports, but you may have to pay taxes in the destination country.

You can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates) the VAT on most goods you export to non-EU countries.
