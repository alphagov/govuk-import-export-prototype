You may need to [get a licence](/starting-to-export/export-licences) to export certain goods outside the EU.

You must make an [export declaration](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) to export goods to a country outside the EU. 

You might also have to [pay custom duties](LINK) and taxes in the destination country.

Use the [trade tariff](LINK) to check commodity codes for classifying your goods so that you pay the right tax and duty.

You can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates) most goods you export to non-EU countries.
