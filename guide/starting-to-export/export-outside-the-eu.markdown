You may need to [get a licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to export certain goods outside the EU.

You must make an [export declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) to export goods to a country outside the EU. 

You won't usually pay UK duty on exports, but you may have to pay taxes in the destination country.

Use the [trade tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html) to check commodity codes for classifying your goods.

You can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates) most goods you export to non-EU countries.
