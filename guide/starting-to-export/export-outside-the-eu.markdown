You may need to get a licence to export [certain goods](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) outside the EU.

You must make an [export declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) to export goods to a country outside the EU. 

You won't usually pay UK duty on exports, but you may have to pay taxes in the destination country.

Use the [Trade Tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html) to check what commodity code you need on your export documents.

You can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates) the VAT on most goods you export to non-EU countries.
