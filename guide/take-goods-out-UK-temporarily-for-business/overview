##Take goods out of the EU temporarily

If you’re taking goods out of the EU, most countries have a limit on the value of goods you can bring in duty free.

If you get [an ATA carnet](link to part 2) (Admission Temporaire carnet), you don’t have to pay duty on goods you bring in temporarily for business reasons. For example, professional equipment like laptops or cameras or sales samples. 

##Temporary export licences

You don’t need permission to move most goods to another EU country.

You must have an export licence to export controlled goods, even if the goods are going to another EU country. But you can get a special export license to temporarily export some controlled goods, eg:

- [controlled drugs for personal use](/travelling-controlled-drugs) 
- [arms, weapons or dual use goods and services](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html) (eg for a trade show)
