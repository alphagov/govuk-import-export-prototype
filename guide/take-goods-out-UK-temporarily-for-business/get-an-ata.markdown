You can get an ATA carnet (Admission Temporaire carnet) to take some types of goods out of the EU temporarily.

An ATA carnet lets you use a simplified process instead of making an export declaration. And it means that you don’t have to pay customs duty.

You can usually get an ATA carnet to temporarily export:

- samples to show at trade fairs or sales meetings
- publicity materials
- recorded film and audio
- equipment you need for work (eg laptops, cameras or sound equipment)
- goods for educational, scientific or cultural purposes
- personal effects and sports goods

Some countries have their own rules about what goods you can bring in with an ATA carnet. Check with [the ATA issuer in the country you’re exporting to](http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/ata-connections/).

An ATA carnet is valid for 12 months, and you can use it as many times as you like.

##Countries you can export to with an ATA carnet

You can use an ATA carnet to export goods temporarily to [around 70 countries](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/13618.pdf) (PDF, 156KB).

##Apply for an ATA carnet

[Apply for an ATA carnet](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=100) on the London Chamber of Commerce website.

You’ll need to pay a fee and a security deposit. 

If you can’t use an ATA carnet (or don’t want to pay the fee), use a ‘[duplicate list](link to part 3)’ instead.

##How to use an ATA carnet

You’ll need a customs officer to stamp your ATA carnet at the port or airport.

Before you start your journey, you must call the HMRC imports and exports helpline to check that a customs officer will be available at the port or airport the goods are being shipped from.

##When you return to the UK

Go the the red channel at customs if you’re bringing the goods back in your baggage.

[Question for SME: if I’m bringing back the goods by freight, how do I know whether I need to complete a C21? Will I be told at customs, or is it something I can determine in advance?]
