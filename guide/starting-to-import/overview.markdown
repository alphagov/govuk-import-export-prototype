What you need to do to import goods to the UK depends on whether they come from:

- [inside the EU or EEA](/guide/starting-to-import/bringing-eu-goods-into-uk.html)
- [outside the EU or EEA](/guide/starting-to-import/importing-goods-from-outside-eu-eea.html)

Thereâ€™s a different process if you [receive goods from outside the EU by post](/goods-sent-from-abroad) - eg after buying goods on an online auction site.
