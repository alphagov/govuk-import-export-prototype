You must get a licence to bring [certain goods](/guide/starting-to-import/import-licences.html) into the UK.

%If you don’t get a licence when you need one, you could be fined and your goods will be seized by customs.%

You’ll need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if the goods were originally brought in from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid on them.

##After you export

You must report through the [Intrastat system](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) if you’ve brought goods worth more than £1.5 million from other EU countries in the previous calendar year.
