You may need to get a licence to bring [certain goods](/guide/starting-to-import/import-licences.html) into the UK.

##Declarations and reports

You don’t usually need to make an import declaration to bring goods into the UK from another [EU or EEA country](/eu-eea).

You’ll need to make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) if the goods were originally brought in from outside the EU and there’s still duty to be paid on them.

You must report through the [Intrastat system](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) if you’ve brought goods worth more than £1.5 million from other EU countries in the previous calendar year.
