[Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-import/import-licences.html) or to follow special rules to bring goods into the UK.

If you don't, you don't need to do anything to receive your goods.

##After you export

You must report through the [Intrastat system](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/when-you-must-register.html) if you’ve brought goods worth more than £1.5 million from other EU countries in the previous calendar year.
