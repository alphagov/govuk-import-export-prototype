s1. [Check if you need a licence](/guide/starting-to-import/import-licences.html) or to follow special rules to bring goods into the UK.
s2. Make sure you know how much import duty you’ll have to pay. Ask the exporter for a breakdown of costs (you can [double check  with the trade tariff]((/start/trade-tariff.html)) to see if you have a correct estimation).


##Excise duties

You may pay duty on:

- [alcohol](/topic/business-tax/alcohol-duties)   
- [fuel](/topic/business-tax/fuel-duty)   
- [tobacco](/topic/business-tax/tobacco-products-duty)  

##Customs duties

You'll be charged customs duty on imports over £135 (including postage, packaging and insurance), unless the duty payment comes to under £7.

You may be able to [set up a deferment account](/delay-paying-customs-duty-when-you-import-goods.html) with HMRC to delay paying customs duties.

##Gifts and personal belongings

Some goods that are sent to you by an individual rather than a company can be exempt from VAT or duty that was due otherwise.

If a personal belonging is being returned to you, you won’t have to pay anything as long as the sender declares this.

###Reduced customs duty for gifts

You may be able to pay less duty if you’re receiving a gift over £135, [call the helpline](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) to find out. 

Gifts between £135 and £600 will usually have 2.5% or less duty.
