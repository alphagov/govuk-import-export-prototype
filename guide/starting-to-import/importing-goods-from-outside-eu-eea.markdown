You may need to [get a licence](link to part 4) to bring certain goods into the UK.

You must [make an import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) to bring goods into the UK from outside the EU or EEA.

## Customs duties

You will usually pay:

- import duty
- import VAT on goods that aren’t exempt

Use the [Trade Tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html) to find out how much import duty and import VAT you will pay.

You may also pay [alcohol duty](/topic/business-tax/alcohol-duties), [fuel duty](/topic/business-tax/fuel-duty) or [tobacco duty](/topic/business-tax/tobacco-products-duty).

If you're a regular importer you may be able to [set up a deferment account](/delay-paying-customs-duty-when-you-import-goods.html) with HMRC to delay paying customs duties.

## Claim relief on import duty

You won’t have to pay import duty if you qualify for relief:

- [Community Systems Relief](/guide/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/who-can-claim-relief.html) (for donated or non commercial goods)
- [Outward Processing Relief](/guide/outward-processing-relief/overview.html)
