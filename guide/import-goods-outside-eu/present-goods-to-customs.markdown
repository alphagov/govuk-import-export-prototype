You must present imported goods to customs within 3 hours of them being unloaded. Complete [form C1600A](/government/publications/import-and-export-presentation-of-third-country-goods-c1600a) and hand it to the customs office. 

You must make a summary declaration 24 hours after you presented the goods to customs. Complete [form C1600](/government/publications/import-and-export-summary-declaration-goods-arrived-from-non-ec-countries-c1600) and give it to the customs office. 

^If you use an agent or freight forwarder, they'll do this for you.^
