You must keep records for 4 years. This means:

- commercial invoices
- valuation forms

##If you used the Import Control System (ICS)

You also need to keep copies of declarations you made through ICS. You can get summary reports of them from the Management Support System (MSS).

###Using MSS

You can get a free month’s sample data to check that a standard MSS report covers what you need. Write to the MSS team on company stationery, including:

- your business name and address
- EORI number
- email address where you want the report sent
- whether you want information on imports, exports or both
- the signature of a director, partner or owner of your business

### Standard MSS reports

If standard MSS reports meet your needs, you can order:

- monthly  reports
- reports showing historical information from up to 4 years ago

To order, fill in the [MSS agreement form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381489/Agreement_for_the_Sale_of_Management_Support_System__MSS__Data.pdf) (PDF, 111KB). 

Reports cost £20 plus VAT for each month covered. You’ll get the reports by email, as an MS Excel spreadsheet.

### Bespoke MSS reports

Contact the MSS team to order if you need a bespoke report. Reports cost £35.31 plus VAT for each month covered.
