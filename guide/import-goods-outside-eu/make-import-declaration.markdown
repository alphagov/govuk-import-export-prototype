You can make an import declaration to the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system by:

* using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
* using the Import Control System (ICS)

^You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).^

##Using software

Search online for commercial software that can send import declarations using CHIEF.

### Develop your own software

You can also develop software that’s compatible with CHIEF, based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML

Contact the CHIEF Operations Team for details.

##Using ICS

If you only make export declarations occasionally you can use the online ICS.

^This is a lengthy and complicated process - the vast majority of smaller exporters use a freight forwarder or agent to make a declaration for them.^

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. [Register with HMRC’s Import Control System (Import Control System)](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/organisation)(ICS). 
s3. You’ll be sent an activation code in the post. The envelope will be marked 'Government Gateway'. The letter can take up to a week to arrive after you register. You’ll need your Activation Code to activate the service.
s4. Login to ICS and enter your Activation Code to make your declaration using XML. 

^You can [check if your business already has an EORI number.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en) If you need help getting an EORI number, contact the [EORI team](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIContact).

###Get help

If ICS is unavailable, you can continue to use it. Your declarations will be queued until the system is available.

You can get general help and advice on using ICS.
