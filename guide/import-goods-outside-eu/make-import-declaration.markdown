You can make a export declaration by:

* using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
* using the Import Control System (ICS) system

^You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).^

##Using software
Search online for commercial software with ICS functionality that can send import declarations.

### Develop your own software
You can also develop software if it’s compatible with the [UK Trader Interface Specifications (TIS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382876/tis-ics-2-5.pdf)(PDF, 1.51MB)

##Using ICS
If you only make export declarations occasionally you can use the online ICS (Import Control System).
^This is a lengthy and complicated process - the vast majority of smaller exporters use a freight forwarder or agent to make a declaration for them.^
s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. [Register with HMRC’s Import Control System (Import Control System)](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration/organisation)(ICS). 
s3. You’ll be sent an activation code in the post. The envelope will be marked 'Government Gateway'. The letter can take up to a week to arrive after you register. You’ll need your Activation Code to activate the service.
s4. Login to ICS and enter your Activation Code to make your declaration using XML. 

##What to do if you have problems with ICS

If ICS is unavailable, you should continue to make declarations on it. These will be queued until the system is available.

##Get help

If you need help getting an EORI number, contact the [EORI team](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIContact).
[Contact HMRC](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/new-computerised-transit-system-enquiries) for advice on using ICS.

##Records you must keep

You must keep records for 4 years. This means:

- copies of declarations you made online through NES
- commercial invoices
- valuation forms
