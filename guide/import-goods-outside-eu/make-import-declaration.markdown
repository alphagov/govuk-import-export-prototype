s1. You'll need an Economic Operator Registration Identification number (EORI) - [check if your business already has one](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en). 
s2. If your business doesn’t have an EORI number, apply for one as a [VAT registered business](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or a [business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s3. [Register with HMRC’s Import Control System (Import Control System)](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/registration)(ICS). 
s4. You’ll be sent an activation code in the post. The envelope will be marked 'Government Gateway'. The letter can take up to a week to arrive after you register. You’ll need your Activation Code to activate the service.
s5. Login to ICS and enter your Activation Code to make your declaration using XML. 

^You can use an agent or freight forwarder to make a declaration for you.^

If you're a regular importer, you may be able to use a simplified import procedure to [speed up the import process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).

You must submit an import declaration at least:

- 24 hours before loading at the departure port, for containerised maritime cargo
- 4 hours before arrival, for maritime bulk and break bulk cargo
- 2 hours before arrival, for maritime sea voyages of less than 24 hours 
- the time of actual take off, for short-haul flights (less than 4 hours duration)
- 4 hours before arrival, for long haul flights (more than 4 hours duration)
- 2 hours before arrival, for rail and inland waterways
- 1 hour before arrival, for road traffic

##What to do if you have problems with ICS

If ICS is unavailable, you should continue to make declarations on it. These will be queued until the system is available.
