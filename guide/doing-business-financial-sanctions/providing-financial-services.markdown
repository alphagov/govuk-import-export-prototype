Financial services providers must follow the [general rules on dealing with people and organisations who are subject to financial sanctions](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/overview.html).

## Terrorism and terrorist financing

You must [get a licence](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/apply-licence.html) to provide finacial services to anyone on the [list of designated persons](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504365/terrorism.pdf) (PDF, 238KB).
