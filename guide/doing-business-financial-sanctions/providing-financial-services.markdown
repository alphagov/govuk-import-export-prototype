Financial services providers must follow the [general rules on dealing with people and organisations who are subject to financial sanctions].

## Terrorism and terrorist financing

You must [get a licence](link to part 3) to provide finacial services to anyone on the [list of designated persons](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504365/terrorism.pdf) (PDF, 238KB).

HM Treasury won’t usually grant a licence to provide financial services to a designated person, unless it’s for insurance or life assurance.

## Syria

You must not provide any financial services to anyone on the [list of financial sanctions targets in Syria](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487325/syria.pdf) (PDF, 92KB).

## If you’re providing financial services under a licence

You must [tell HM Treasury](link to part 4) as soon as possible if you’re dealing with a client under a financial services licence and they commit an offence under financial sanctions (eg they breach the terms of their licence).
