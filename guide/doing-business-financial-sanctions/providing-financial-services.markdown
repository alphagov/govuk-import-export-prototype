Financial services providers must follow the [general rules on dealing with people and organisations who are subject to financial sanctions](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/overview.html).

## Terrorism and terrorist financing

You must [get a licence](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/apply-licence.html) to provide financial services to anyone on the [terrorism and terrorism financing list of designated persons](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504365/terrorism.pdf) (PDF, 238KB).

This includes banking, credit, insurance and insurance related services. For example:

* direct life assurance 
* reinsurance and retrocession
* services auxiliary to insurance (including consultancy, actuarial, risk assessment and claim and settlement services) 
* accepting deposits 
* lending
* financial trading
* payment and money transmission services
* money brokering
* asset management
* settlement and clearing services for financial assets 
* advisory and other auxiliary financial services 

### General licences

There are general licences in place for:

* insurance, including life assurance
* temporarily receiving goods or services under an insurance policy
* legal aid
* legal expenses paid by someone else

If there's a general licence in place, it means you don't have to apply for a licence in advance. But you must report any work done under a general licence to the [Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/get-help.html) straight away.

You must [apply for a separate licence](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/apply-licence.html) if you want to make funds or resources available in a way that's not covered by the general licence.

## Russia

If a company is on the capital markets measures list, you must not deal in any transferable securities or money market instruments issued by that company:

* between 1 August and 12 September 2014, with a maturity of more than 90 days
* after September 2014, with a maturity of more than 30 days

Dealing includes buying, selling and providing brokering and issuance services - directly and indirectly.
You must not be part of any arrangement to make new loans or credit with a maturity of more than 30 days to a company on the capital markets measures list - directly or indirectly.

## Syria

[Council Regulation (EU) 36/2012](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R0036&qid=1475514789675) (as amended) puts restrictions on:

* buying or selling certain Syrian public or guaranteed bonds
* establishing new banking relationships
* providing certain insurance and reinsurance products to specified individuals and organisations

## If you’re providing services under a financial sanctions licence

You must [tell the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/get-help.html) as soon as possible if you’re dealing with a client or customer under a financial services licence and they commit an offence under financial sanctions (for example they breach the terms of their licence).

^There are additional restrictions on financing [deals for military or dual use goods, services and technologies](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html) and [deals related to the oil and gas industry in Russia](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-energy-related-goods-technology-and-services.html).^
