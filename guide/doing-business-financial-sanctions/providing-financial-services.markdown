Financial services providers must follow the [general rules on dealing with people and organisations who are subject to financial sanctions](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/overview.html).

## Terrorism and terrorist financing

You must [get a licence](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/apply-licence.html) to provide finacial services to anyone on the [list of designated persons](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/504365/terrorism.pdf) (PDF, 238KB), directly or indirectly or in a way that benefits them. For example:

* banking services, credit or financial trading
* securities, money brokering, assessment management or settlement or clearing services
* financial information or advice, including advice on acquisitions and corporate restructuring

There are general licences in place for:

* insurance, including life assurance
* legal aid
* legal expenses paid by someone else

This means that you don’t have to apply for a licence in advance, but you must [contact the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation with the details](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/get-help.html) straight away.


## Russia
