## What you must do

If a person or organisation is on the consolidated list you must also [get a licence from HM Treasury](link to part 3) to deal with them in a way that gives them a significant financial benefit.

For example:

- making funds or resources available to them directly (eg by buying something from them, employing them, giving them a gift or loan or repaying a loan from them)
- making funds or resources available to them indirectly (eg by making a payment to an organisation that’s controlled by them)

‘Resources’ can mean anything with a potential value, not just cash or investments.

## Asset freezes

If a person or organisation is on the consolidated list it means they have had their assets frozen. This means you must [get a licence from HM Treasury](link to part 3) to:

give them access to assets you’re holding on their behalf (eg letting them withdraw money from a bank account)
buy, sell or deal with assets that belong to them, or are held or controlled by them

There are [additional requirements](link to part 2) about providing financial services to someone who is subject to financial sanctions.

%It’s a criminal offence not to get a licence.%

## If you find out someone you’re dealing with is subject to financial sanctions

If you find out that someone you’re dealing with is subject to financial sanctions, you must immediately:

- stop dealing with them
- freeze any assets you are holding for them

Then [tell HM Treasury](link to part 4) as soon as possible.

You won’t be prosecuted unless you knew - or reasonably, should have known - that the person you were dealing with was subject to financial sanctions.
