Fill in the [financial sanctions licence application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/448158/Generic_Licence_Application_Form.doc) (MS Word, 76.5KB) to apply for permission to deal with someone who is subject to financial sanctions or release frozen assets..

[Send the form to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/get-help.html). 

Generally, they only give a licence for dealings which let the person or organisation who is subject to financial sanctions:

- meet basic living expenses
- pay legal fees
- pay routine fees for holding frozen assets
- settle a court judgement or make a payment under a contract from before the asset freeze

You can also apply for a licence to let the person or organisation who is subject to financial sanctions meet 'extraordinary' expenses. OFSI will look at the circumstances, including:

- whether there’s a humanitarian reason to grant the licence (eg the funds will be used for medical treatment)
- whether granting a licence would avoid causing problems for people who aren’t sanctions targets (eg so staff wages can be paid)

Apply at least 4 weeks in advance, and earlier if you can. 

You can be prosecuted if you provide false or misleading information in a licence application.
