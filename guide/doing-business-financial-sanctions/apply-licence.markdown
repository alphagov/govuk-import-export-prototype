Fill in the [financial sanctions licence application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/448158/Generic_Licence_Application_Form.doc) (MS Word, 76.5KB) to apply for permission to make funds available to someone who is subject to financial sanctions.

Licence applications can be complex. For example, there's sometimes a requirement to notify or get prior approval from bodies such as the EU or UN. You may want to gete legal advice before applying for a licence.

[Send the form to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)](/guide/doing-business-financial-sanctions/get-help.html). 

OFSI can only give a licence when the relevant legislation allows them to do so. For example, they may give a licence for:

* payment of  basic living expenses
* payment of legal fees
* payment of routine fees for holding frozen assets
* payment under a contract from before the asset freeze
* settling a court judgement
* humanitarian reasons

You can also apply for a licence to let the person or organisation who is subject to financial sanctions meet 'extraordinary' expenses.

This means expenses that aren't recurring and couldn't have been easily anticipated. It doesn't include expenses covered by one of the other reasons for giving a licence. 

Apply at least 4 weeks in advance, or earlier if you can.

Don't assume that the licence will be granted, and don't do anything that's prohibited by financial sanctions until you've been given a signed licence.

You can be prosecuted if you provide false or misleading information in a licence application.
