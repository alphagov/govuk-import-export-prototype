Fill in the [financial sanctions licence application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/448158/Generic_Licence_Application_Form.doc) (MS Word, 76.5KB) to apply for permission to deal with someone who is subject to financial sanctions.

[Send the form to HM Treasury](link to part 4). They will look at the circumstances, including:

- whether there’s a humanitarian reason to grant the licence (eg the funds will be used for medical treatment)
- whether granting a licence would avoid causing problems for people who aren’t sanctions targets (eg so staff wages can be paid)
