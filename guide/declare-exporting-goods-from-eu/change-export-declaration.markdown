If you need to amend details on an export declaration, you must both:

- complete [form C81](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/C81&template=C81.xdp) online
- send a letter of explanation to the Trade and Statistical Office
