You must keep records for 4 years. This means:

- copies of declarations you made online through NES or paper SAD (Single Administrative Document) forms
- commercial invoices
- valuation forms

You can either:

- make you own copies of declarations you made online through NES
- get summary reports of your declarations from the Management Support System (MSS)

##Get summary reports of your declarations from MSS

Before you order, check what’s in a standard MSS report to check that it covers what you need. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to order a bespoke report. 

You can also order one month’s sample data free of charge. To order sample data, write to the MSS team on company stationery. Include:

- your business name and address
- EORI number
- email address where you want the report sent
- whether you want information on imports, exports or both

The letter must be signed by a director, partner or owner of your business. 

### Standard MSS reports

Complete the [MSS agreement form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381489/Agreement_for_the_Sale_of_Management_Support_System__MSS__Data.pdf) (PDF, 111KB) to order standard MSS reports. Then post the completed form to the MSS team.

You can use the MSS agreement form to order:

- monthly standard reports
- standard reports showing historical information from up to 4 years ago

Standard reports cost £20 plus VAT for each month covered.

You’ll get the reports by email, as an MS Excel document.

### Bespoke MSS reports

Contact the MSS team to order a bespoke report if a standard report doesn’t cover what you need.

Bespoke reports cost £35.31 plus VAT for each month covered.
