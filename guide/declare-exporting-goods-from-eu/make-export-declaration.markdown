If you make export declarations regularly, you can buy commercial software to make declarations via the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system.

Search online for software suppliers.

## Develop your own software

You can also develop software that’s compatible with CHIEF, based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML

Contact the CHIEF Operations Team for details.
