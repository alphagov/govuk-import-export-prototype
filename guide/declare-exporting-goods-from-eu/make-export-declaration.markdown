You can make an export declaration to the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system by:

- using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
- using the  National Export System (NES)

^You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).^

##Using software

Search online for commercial software that can send export declarations using CHIEF.

### Develop your own software

You can also develop software that’s compatible with CHIEF, based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML

Contact the CHIEF Operations Team for details.

##Using NES

If you only make export declarations occasionally you can use the online  National Export System (NES).

^This is a lengthy and complicated process - the vast majority of smaller exporters use a freight forwarder or agent to make a declaration for them.^

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Sign up to use NES on the [Government Gateway website.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/)
s3. [Sign in](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html) to NES.

^You can [check if your business already has an EORI number.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en)


###Get help  

You can get help getting an EORI number by [contacting the EORI team.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIContact)

If NES is unavailable for half a working day or more, contact the helpline to make a declaration through another route (called a 'fallback route').
