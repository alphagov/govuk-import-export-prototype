s1. You'll need an Economic Operator Registration Identification number (EORI) - [check if your business already has one](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en). 
s2. If your business doesn’t have an EORI number, apply for one as a [VAT registered business](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or a [business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Register to make declarations through [Government Gateway](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/).
s3. [Submit your export declaration through NES.](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html).

^You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/link).^

##What to do if you have technical problems with NES

You can make an export declaration through another route (called a 'fallback route') if NES is down for at least half a working day. 

Contact the NES helpline to find out about fallback routes.

If you need to use a fallback route, you must provide all of the following:

- [form C88/ESS](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/386159/c88-ess.pdf) (PDF, 34.9KB)    
- [form C1402](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374217/c1402f.pdf) (PFD, 24.6KB)
- [form C130EX](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374206/c130ex.pdf) (PDF, 10.6KB)
