You must make a declaration to export goods outside the [EU](/eu-eea). 

You can pay an agent or freight forwarder to make the declaration for you. If you choose to do it yourself, you make the declaration to the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system by either:

- using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
- using the  National Export System (NES)

You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).^

^Check the rules if you [you move goods to EU special territories](/guide/move-goods-eu/special-territories.html), eg Channel Islands or Canary Islands.

##Deadlines

Method of transport | Deadline for making a declaration
- | -
‘Deep sea’ containerised cargo | 24 hours before goods are loaded
‘Short sea’ containerised cargo | 2 hours before leaving the port
Air traffic | 30 minutes before departure
Rail and inland waters traffic | 2 hours before departure
Road traffic | 1 hour before departure
Supplies for ships and aircraft | 15 minutes before departure


[Question for SME: Are these time limits just for online declarations for all types of export declaration?]

###Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) goods

You must make an export declaration if you move CAP goods, including:
 
- supplies within the EU for providing food on seagoing vessels or aircraft serving on international routes, including intra-EU routes
- supplies to international organisations in the EU
