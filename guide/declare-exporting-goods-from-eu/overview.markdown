##Time limits for online or software declarations

You must make an export declaration at least: 

- 24 hours before the goods are loaded, for ‘deep sea’ containerised cargo
- 2 hours before leaving the port for ‘short sea’ containerised cargo
- 30 minutes before departure from an airport for air traffic 
- 2 hours before departure for rail and inland waters traffic
- 1 hour before departure for road traffic 
- 15 minutes before departure for supplies for ships and aircraft

- the Aland Islands (Finland)
- the Canary Islands
- the Channel Islands
- French Overseas Department of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion
