You must make a declaration to export goods outside the [EU](/eu-eea). 

You can either:

- pay an agent or freight forwarder to make the declaration for you
- [make the declaration yourself](/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/make-export-declaration.html) through the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system

^Check the rules if [you move goods to EU special territories](/guide/move-goods-eu/special-territories.html), eg Channel Islands or Canary Islands.

##Deadlines

Method of transport | Deadline for making a declaration
- | -
‘Deep sea’ containerised cargo | 24 hours before goods are loaded
‘Short sea’ containerised cargo | 2 hours before leaving the port
Air traffic | 30 minutes before departure
Rail and inland waters traffic | 2 hours before departure
Road traffic | 1 hour before departure
Supplies for ships and aircraft | 15 minutes before departure

If the goods are passing through another EU country on their way out of the EU, the deadline counts from the time when they leave the EU. Not when they leave the UK.

[Question for SME: Are these time limits just for online declarations for all types of export declaration?]
