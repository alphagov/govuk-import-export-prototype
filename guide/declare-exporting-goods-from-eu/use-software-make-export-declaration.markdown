You can pay an agent or freight forwarder to make an export declaration for you.

If you choose to do it yourself, you’ll send declarations using the Customs Handling Import and Export Freight (CHIEF) system. You can do this by:

- using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
- using the  National Export System (NES)

^You may be able to use a simplified export procedure to [speed up the export process](/apply-simplified-declaration-procedure-sdp-imports-exports.html).^

##Using software

Search online for commercial software that can send export declarations using CHIEF.

### Develop your own software

You can also develop software that’s compatible with CHIEF, based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML

Contact the CHIEF Operations Team for details.

##Using NES

If you only make export declarations occasionally you can use the online the National Export System (NES).

^This is a lengthy and complicated process - the vast majority of exporters use a freight forwarder or agent to make a declaration for them.^


s1. You'll need an EORI number - [check if your business already has one.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en). 
s2. If your business doesn’t have an EORI number, apply for one as a [VAT registered business](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or a [business that isn’t registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Register to make declarations through [Government Gateway.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/).
s3. [Submit your export declaration through the National Export System (NES).](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html)

###Get help

You can get help getting an EORI number by [contacting the EORI team](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIContact).

If NES is unavailable for half a working day or more, contact the helpline to make a declaration through another route (called a 'fallback route').
