You can use an ATA Carnet in [around 70 countries](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/13618.pdf) (PDF, 156KB).

Countries have their own rules about what goods you can bring in with an ATA Carnet. Check with the issuer in the [country you’re exporting to.](http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/ata-connections/)

If you can’t use an ATA Carnet (or don’t want to pay the fee), use a [Duplicate List](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/you-dont-use-ata.html) to temporarily export your goods instead.

##How to apply

You can apply:

 * [online](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lccicarnet/index.aspx)  
 * [by post](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=100)

If you’re using a freight forwarder, they’ll usually fill this in for you.

It usually costs £325.96 and you'll need to pay a security deposit. 

^If you’re sending goods to Taiwan, apply for a [Taiwan Carnet](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=100) instead.

##Using an ATA Carnet

Call the HMRC imports and exports helpline before your journey.

They'll check that a customs officer can stamp your Carnet at the port or airport your goods are being shipped from.

##When you return to the UK

Go through the red channel at customs if you’re bringing the goods back in your baggage.

[Question for SME: if I’m bringing back the goods by freight, how do I know whether I need to complete a C21? Will I be told at customs, or is it something I can determine in advance?]
