You can use an ATA Carnet in [around 70 countries](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/docimages/13618.pdf) (PDF, 156KB).

Countries have their own rules about what goods you can bring in with an ATA Carnet. Check with [the issuer in the country you’re exporting to](http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/ata-connections/).^

##How to apply

You can apply:

 * [online](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lccicarnet/index.aspx)  
 * [by post](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=100)

You'll need to pay a £325.96 fee and a security deposit. 

If you can’t use an ATA Carnet (or don’t want to pay the fee), use a [Duplicate List](link to part 3) instead.

^If you’re sending goods to Taiwan, you can apply for a [Taiwan Carnet.](http://www.londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/article.asp?aid=100)

##How to use an ATA Carnet

Call the HMRC imports and exports helpline before your journey.

They'll need to check that a customs officer can stamp your Carnet at the port or airport your goods are being shipped from.

##When you return to the UK

Go through the red channel at customs if you’re bringing the goods back in your baggage.

[Question for SME: if I’m bringing back the goods by freight, how do I know whether I need to complete a C21? Will I be told at customs, or is it something I can determine in advance?]
