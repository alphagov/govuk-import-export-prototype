Use a ‘duplicate list’ to temporarily export goods if:

- the country you’re exporting to doesn’t recognise the ATA carnet
- you don’t want to pay for an ATA carnet

As with an ATA carnet, you don’t have to pay customs duty or tax. There’s no fee, but it’s not as simple as exporting something with an ATA carnet.

###How to export goods using a duplicate list

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline in advance to make the arrangements.

Before you export the goods, prepare a list on company stationery. Include:

- a description of the goods
- how many there are
- serial numbers, if the goods have them
- value of the goods

At customs, you’ll need to provide:

- 2 copies of the list 
- a completed [form C&E 1246](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374161/ce1246.pdf)
