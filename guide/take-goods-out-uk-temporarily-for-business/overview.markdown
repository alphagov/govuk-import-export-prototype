You may need permission to temporarily move or export goods outside the UK, eg if you take sales samples to a trade show.

If you're temporarily exporting goods outside the EU for processing or repair, [there are different rules](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/outward-processing-relief-opr) - you might be eligible for outward processing relief.

##Move goods around the EU 

You donâ€™t need permission to temporarily move goods to another EU country unless they're controlled, eg weapons.

##Export goods out of the EU 

Most countries have a limit on the value of goods you can bring in duty free.

You can usually get [an ATA Carnet](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/get-an-ata.html) to avoid paying duty on goods you bring in temporarily for business reasons, including:

- samples to show at trade fairs or sales meetings
- publicity materials
- recorded film and audio
- equipment you need for work (eg laptops, cameras or sound equipment)
- goods for educational, scientific or cultural purposes
- personal effects and sports goods

##Weapons, drugs and other controlled goods

You'll need a licence to temporarily move [controlled goods](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html) outside the UK. You can get a temporary licence for some types of controlled goods, for example:

- [controlled drugs for personal use](/travelling-controlled-drugs) 
- [weapons or dual use goods and services](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html)
