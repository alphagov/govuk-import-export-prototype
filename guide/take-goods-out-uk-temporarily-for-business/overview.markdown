You may need permission to temporarily move or export goods outside the UK, eg sales samples for a trade show

##Move goods around the EU 

You don’t need permission to temporarily move goods to another EU country unless they're controlled, eg weapons.

##Export goods out of the EU 

Most countries have a limit on the value of goods you can bring in duty free.

You can usually get [an ATA Carnet](link to part 2) to avoid paying duty on goods you bring in temporarily for business reasons, including:

- samples to show at trade fairs or sales meetings
- publicity materials
- recorded film and audio
- equipment you need for work (eg laptops, cameras or sound equipment)
- goods for educational, scientific or cultural purposes
- personal effects and sports goods

##Weapons, drugs and other controlled goods

You'll need a licence to temporarily move [controlled goods -link?] outside the UK. You can get a temporary licence for some types of controlled goods, for example:

- [controlled drugs for personal use](/travelling-controlled-drugs) 
- [weapons or dual use goods and services](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html) (eg for a trade show)
