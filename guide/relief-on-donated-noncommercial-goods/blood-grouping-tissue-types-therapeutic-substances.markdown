You can get relief if you’re either:

- a public institution or laboratory, eg Strategic Health Authorities, public health laboratories, all schools of pharmacy, medical schools, medical research council and registered charities
- a private establishment approved by the Department of Health (DoH)

##Goods eligible for relief

You can get relief when you import any of the following:

- human blood and its derivatives (whole human blood, dried human plasma, human albumin and fixed solutions of human plasmic protein, human immunoglobin and human fibrinogen)
- all reagents whether of human, animal, plant or other origin used for blood-type grouping and for the detection of blood incompatibilities
- all reagents whether of human, animal, plant or other origin used for the determination of human tissue types
- the special packaging essential for the transport of the above goods and also any solvents and accessories needed for their use which may be included in the consignments

^The goods must be for non-commercial medical or scientific purposes by approved laboratories or institutions.^

##How to claim relief

s1. If you’re a private establishment, you must apply to the DoH for approval. DoH will issue you an approval letter - you must attach a copy of this to your import declaration and make sure it’s available for inspection at customs.   
S2. If you need one, attach the DoH letter to your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html).   
s2. Use the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html) [when you make your import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html).
