You can get relief if you’re either:

- a public institution or laboratory, eg Strategic Health Authorities, public health laboratories, all schools of pharmacy, medical schools, medical research council and registered charities
- a private establishment approved by the National Import Relief Unit (NIRU)

##Goods eligible for relief

You can get relief when you import any of the following:

- human blood and its derivatives (whole human blood, dried human plasma, human albumin and fixed solutions of human plasmic protein, human immunoglobin and human fibrinogen)
- all reagents whether of human, animal, plant or other origin used for blood-type grouping and for the detection of blood incompatibilities
- all reagents whether of human, animal, plant or other origin used for the determination of human tissue types
- the special packaging essential for the transport of the above goods and also any solvents and accessories needed for their use which may be included in the consignments

^The goods must be for non-commercial medical or scientific purposes by approved laboratories or institutions.^

##How to claim relief

s1. If you’re a private establishment, you must apply for approval from NIRU before the goods are imported. NIRU will send you an approval letter.  
s2. Attach the approval letter to your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) and enter the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html).

^You can use an agent or freight forwarder if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^

###If you’ve applied for but not yet received NIRU approval

You must give NIRU a financial guarantee (for example, a cash deposit or bankers’ guarantee) to cover the duty and VAT.

Once you’ve got your approval letter, contact your local HMRC supervising office to claim it back. Their contact details will be on the export declaration.
