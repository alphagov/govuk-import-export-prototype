You can get relief from duty, and in some cases VAT, if you’re importing goods into the EU for:

- [museums and galleries](/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/museums-and-galleries.html)
- [charities](/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/charities.html) 
- [scientific instruments](/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/scientific-instruments.html) - for use in educational establishments, as well as the NHS
- [donated medical equipment](/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/donated-medical-equipment.html) - for research, diagnosis and treatment for a health authority or hospital department 
- educational, scientific, cultural and professional documents
- capital goods 
- [animals for scientific research](/relief-on-donated-noncommercial-goods/animals-for-scientific-research.html)
- biological and chemical substances for scientific research
- commercial samples of negligible value
- inherited goods
- blood grouping, tissue types and therapeutic substances
- disabled people

This is called Community System Duty Reliefs (CSDR).

^You can use a [freight forwarder](http://www.bifa.org/members) if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^
