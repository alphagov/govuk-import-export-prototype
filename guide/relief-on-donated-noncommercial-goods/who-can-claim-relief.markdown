^You can use a [freight forwarder](http://www.bifa.org/members) if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^

##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and value of the imported goods
- a copy of any customs forms that have been completed
- evidence of ownership (if applicable for the relief claimed)
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - such as manufacturers marks serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even and including after you dispose of the goods.
