##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and value of the goods
- a copy of any customs forms that have been completed
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - eg manufacturers marks, serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even after you dispose of the goods.
