You don’t need to pay customs duty, and in some cases VAT, if you’re importing any of the following into the EU:

- goods for [museums and galleries](/duty-vat-relief-importers-educational-scientific-cultural-goods/museums-and-galleries)
- goods for [charities](/duty-vat-relief-importers-educational-scientific-cultural-goods/charities) 
- [scientific instruments](/scientific-instruments) - for use in educational establishments, as well as the NHS
- [donated medical equipment](/duty-vat-relief-importers-educational-scientific-cultural-goods/donated-medical-equipment) - for research, diagnosis and treatment for a health authority or hospital department 
- educational, scientific, cultural and professional documents
- capital goods 
- [animals for scientific research](/duty-vat-relief-importers-educational-scientific-cultural-goods/animals-for-scientific-research)
- biological and chemical substances for scientific research
- commercial samples of negligible value
- inherited goods
- blood grouping, tissue types and therapeutic substances
- goods for disabled people

This is called Community System Duty Reliefs (CSDR).

##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and value of the goods
- a copy of any customs forms that have been completed
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - eg manufacturers marks, serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even after you dispose of the goods.
