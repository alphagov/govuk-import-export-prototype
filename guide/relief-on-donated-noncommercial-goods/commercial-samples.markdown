You can get relief on goods you import as ‘commercial samples’ (goods only used for demonstration purposes) if you’re either: 

- an established commercial entity in the UK
- a government agency or department, or public institution or public establishment recognised and approved by the National Import Relief Unit (NIRU)

##Goods eligible for relief

To be eligible, your goods must be:

- only used as commercial samples of the products
- imported only with the intention of getting future orders for the type of goods they represent

^Excise goods (eg alcohol or tobacco products) aren’t eligible for relief.^

You must identify the goods as commercial samples by either:

- tearing, altering, perforating, slashing or defacing the items
- using permanent, indelible marking or permanent labelling to clearly mark the item as a ‘commercial sample’

^If the goods can’t be adequately identified as commercial samples (eg jewellery or precious stones), HMRC won’t accept them for relief.^


##Before you claim 

You’ll need an Economic Operator Registration Identification number (EORI) - [check if your business already has one](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en). 

If your business doesn’t have an EORI number, apply for one as a [VAT registered business](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or a [business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)

##How to claim relief

You claim relief when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). Enter one of the following Customs procedure codes into your declaration: 

Nature of the goods | Customs procedure codes
-|-
Imported from outside the Customs Union | 40 00 C30
Imported from inside the Customs Union | 49 00 C30


^You can use an agent or freight forwarder if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^
