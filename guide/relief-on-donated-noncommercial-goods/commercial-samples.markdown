You can get relief on goods you import as ‘commercial samples’ (goods only used for demonstration purposes) if you’re either: 

- an established commercial entity in the UK
- a government agency or department, or public institution or public establishment recognised and approved by the National Import Relief Unit (NIRU)

##Goods eligible for relief

To be eligible, your goods must be:

- only used as commercial samples of the products, in order to show the characteristics of the goods
- imported only with the intention of getting future orders for the type of goods they represent

^Excise goods (eg alcohol or tobacco products) aren’t eligible for relief.^

You must identify the goods as commercial samples by either:

- tearing, altering, perforating, slashing or defacing the items
- use permanent, indelible marking or permanent labelling to clearly mark the item as a ‘commercial sample’

^If the goods can’t be adequately identified as commercial samples (eg jewellry or precious stones), HMRC won’t accept them for relief.^


##How to claim relief

s1. You’ll need an Economic Operator Registration Identification number (EORI) - [check if your business already has one](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en).    
s2. If your business doesn’t have an EORI number, apply for one as a [VAT registered business](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or a [business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport).  
s3. Use the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html) [when you make your import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html).    


##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and value of the imported goods
- a copy of any customs forms that have been completed
- evidence of ownership (if applicable for the relief claimed)
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - such as manufacturers marks serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even and including after you dispose of the goods.
