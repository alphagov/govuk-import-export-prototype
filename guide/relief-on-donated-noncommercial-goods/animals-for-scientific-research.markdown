You can get relief if you're organisation is either:

- a public establishment mainly involved in education or scientific research, eg universities, National Health Service and teaching hospitals
- a private establishment mainly involved in education or scientific research recognised by the Home Office 

##Animals eligible for relief

You can get duty relief on any animal listed under chapters 1 or 3 in the [Trade Tariff](/link). 

You can only get VAT relief if the animals have been supplied free of charge.

You must only use the animals for scientific research purposes. 

^HMRC officers may visit you to confirm that the conditions of the relief are met.^

##How to claim relief

s1. If you're a private establishment, you must ask the Home Office for approval before you can claim relief. The Home Office will send you an approval letter - make sure it’s available for inspection at customs.
s2. Use the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/trade-tariff) [when you make your import declaration](/link).
