You can get duty and VAT relief if you permanently import exhibits for galleries and museums from outside the EU.

##Eligibility

You can get duty relief if all of the following apply:

- the exhibits are of a scientific, educational or cultural nature
- you won’t sell the exhibits
- the exhibits are sent directly on import to your approved establishment
- you exhibit the goods exclusively at your approved establishment

You can get VAT relief if either:

- the exhibits have been donated free of charge or for non-commercial reasons
- you bought the exhibits from a private person

##Apply for approval

Contact National Import Reliefs Unit (NIRU) to apply for approval. NIRU will send you an approval letter - make sure it’s available for inspection at customs.

##How to claim relief
   
You claim relief when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). Enter one of the following customs procedure codes into your declaration:

Nature of the goods | Customs procedure code
-|-
Exhibits imported from outside the Customs Union | 40 00 C12
Exhibits imported from inside the Customs Union | 49 00 C12


If you need to import the exhibits before you receive NIRU approval, you must give NIRU a financial guarantee to cover the duty and VAT. This could be a cash deposit or bankers’ guarantee.

[SME question: how do they pay this guarantee? How do users know how much they need to pay?]

Once you’ve got your approval letter, contact your local HMRC supervising office to claim it back. Their contact details will be on the export declaration.
