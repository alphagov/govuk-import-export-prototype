You can get duty and VAT relief if you permanently import exhibits for galleries and museums from outside the EU.

##Eligibility

You can get duty relief if all of the following apply:

- the exhibits are of a scientific, educational or cultural nature and not for sale
- the exhibits are dispatched directly on import to your approved establishment
- you use the goods exclusively as exhibits under your control
- you keep a record of the exhibits

You can get VAT relief if either:

- the exhibits have been donated free of charge or for non-commercial reasons
- you bought the exhibits from a private person

##How to claim relief

s1. Contact the National Import Reliefs Unit (NIRU) to apply for approval. NIRU will send you an approval letter.
s2. Attach the approval letter to your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) and enter the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html).

###If you've applied for but not yet received NIRU approval

You must give NIRU a financial guarantee (for example, a cash deposit or bankers’ guarantee) to cover the duty and VAT. 
  
Once you’ve got your approval letter, contact your local HMRC supervising office to claim it back. Their contact details will be on the export declaration.
