###If you've applied for but not yet received NIRU approval

You must give NIRU a financial guarantee (for example, a cash deposit or bankers’ guarantee) to cover the duty and VAT. 
  
Once you’ve got your approval letter, contact your local HMRC supervising office to claim it back. Their contact details will be on the export declaration.
