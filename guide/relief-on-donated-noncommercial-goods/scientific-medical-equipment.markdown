##How to claim relief

You claim relief when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). Enter one of the following customs procedure codes into your declaration: 

Nature of the goods | Customs procedure codes
-|-
Imported from outside the Customs Union | 40 00 C13
Imported from one inside the Customs Union | 49 00 C17
Equipment imported for non-commercial purposes to carry out international scientific research | 40 00 C14

If you need to import the exhibits before you receive NIRU approval, you must give NIRU a financial guarantee to cover the duty and VAT. This could be a cash deposit or bankers’ guarantee.

[SME question: how do they pay this guarantee? How do users know how much they need to pay?]

Once you’ve got your approval letter, contact your local HMRC supervising office to claim it back. Their contact details will be on the export declaration.
