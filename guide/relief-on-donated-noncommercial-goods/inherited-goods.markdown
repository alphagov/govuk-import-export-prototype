You can get relief if you inherit goods from a deceased person and you're either:

- an EU resident
- a non-profit making company established in the EU

##Goods eligible for relief

Any goods included in the estate of the deceased person that were intended for your personal use or for meeting your household needs, including:

- jewellry, stamp collection, bicycles, private motor vehicles, caravans, trailers, pleasure craft and private aircraft
- household furnishings
- family pets, horses, ponies and donkeys
- portable items (eg musicians’ instruments, photographers’ cameras and equipment) used by the deceased in their trade or profession

^You must import the goods within 2 years from the date the estate is finally settled.^

##Goods not eligible for relief

You can’t get relief for:

- alcohol and tobacco products
- stocks of raw materials and finished or semi-finished products
- trade tools
- commercial vehicles
- livestock and stocks of agricultural products, which are more than what are required to meet a family’s normal needs
- goods bought from the executor of the estate
- goods bought or received as a gift from the person who legally inherited them

##How to claim relief

You claim relief when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). Enter one of the following Customs procedure codes into your declaration: 

Nature of the goods | Customs procedure codes
-|-
Imported from outside the Customs Union | 40 00 C04
Imported from inside the Customs Union | 49 00 C04

^You can use an agent or freight forwarder if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^

You must attach the following paperwork to your import declaration:

- a copy of the will, or other appropriate legal documents if the deceased died intestate, certified by the executor of the estate or by any other person responsible for winding up the deceased’s estate
- if the goods aren’t detailed in the will, you must provide a list of the goods and their value made by the executor of the estate along with a confirmation that the goods have been passed to you
- a completed [form C1421](/government/publications/vat-inherited-goods-making-a-claim-for-relief-from-duty-and-vat-c1421)

^You must provide translated versions of these documents if they’re not in English.^
