You can get duty and VAT relief when you import inherited goods if you're either:

- an EU resident
- a non-profit making company established in the EU

##Goods eligible for relief

You can get relief on any goods in the deceased person's estate that were intended for your personal use or for meeting your household needs.

^You must import the goods within 2 years from the date the estate is finally settled.^

##Goods not eligible for relief

You can’t get relief for:

- alcohol and tobacco products
- stocks of raw materials and finished or semi-finished products
- trade tools
- commercial vehicles
- livestock and stocks of agricultural products, which are more than what are required to meet a family’s normal needs
- goods bought from the executor of the estate
- goods bought or received as a gift from the person who legally inherited them

##How to claim relief

Use the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html) [when you make your import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). 

You must attach the following paperwork to your import declaration:

- a copy of the will, or other appropriate legal documents if the deceased died itestate, certified by the executor of the estate or by any other person responsible for winding up the deceased’s estate
- if the goods aren’t detailed in the will, you must provide a list of the goods and their value made by the executor of the estate along with a confirmation that the goods have been passed to you
- a completed [form C1421](/government/publications/vat-inherited-goods-making-a-claim-for-relief-from-duty-and-vat-c1421)

^You must provide translated versions of these documents if they’re not in English.^

##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and value of the imported goods
- a copy of any customs forms that have been completed
- evidence of ownership (if applicable for the relief claimed)
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - such as manufacturers marks serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even and including after you dispose of the goods.
