You can import capital goods (eg machinery, tools, computers and other equipment) when you move your business to the UK from the Customs Union. 

##Eligibility

You can get duty relief if all the following apply:

- your business (including limited companies, self employed people and charities) has completely ceased its activity outside the Customs Union
- your business will be moving to the UK to carry on a similar activity there
- your business will be merging with an established UK business, to then produce or provide new products or services

You can get VAT relief if your business:

- only makes [‘taxable supplies’](/vat-businesses/how-vat-works)
- expects to have a taxable turnover over the [UK registration limits for VAT](/vat-registration/overview)

##Goods eligible for relief

To qualify, your goods must be any of the following:

- office and shop equipment or machinery, and other tools of trade
- means of transport used for the purposes of production or for providing a service
- computer and other technical equipment needed to run your business
- if you're an agricultural business, any livestock belonging to your business

The goods must:

- have belonged to and been used by your business continuously for at least 12 months before the transfer of activities to the UK
- be used for exactly the same purpose in the UK
- be appropriate to the nature and size of your business
- be imported from their previous location within 12 months of the date your business ceased activities there


##How to claim relief

You claim relief when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html). Enter one of the following Customs procedure codes into your declaration: 

Nature of the goods | Customs procedure codes
-|-
For companies | 40 00 C09
For self-employed persons and non-profit making organisations | 40 00 C10
For companies importing from the special territories | 49 00 C09
For self-employed persons and non-profit making organisations importing from the special territories  | 49 00 C10


You’ll need to:

- produce evidence to show you’re entitled to this relief
- give HMRC financial security (normally a cash deposit or a banker’s guarantee) to cover the duty and/or VAT before your goods are released

^You can use an agent or freight forwarder if you want to import goods and don’t want to manage the logistics yourself.^
