You can import capital goods (eg machinery, tools, computers and other equipment) when you move your business to the UK from the European Union Customs Union (EUCU). 

##Eligibility

You can get duty relief if your business:

- has completely ceased its activity outside the EUCU
- will be moving to the UK to carry on a similar activity there
- will be merging with an established UK business, to then produce or provide new products or services

You can get VAT relief if your business:

- only makes [‘taxable supplies’](/vat-businesses/how-vat-works)
- expects to have a taxable turnover over the [UK registration limits for VAT](/vat-registration/overview)

##Goods eligible for relief

To qualify, your goods must be any of the following:

- office and shop equipment or machinery, and other tools of trade
- means of transport used for the purposes of production or for providing a service
- computer and other technical equipment needed to run your business
- if you're an agricultural business, any livestock belonging to your business

The goods must:

- have belonged to and been used by your business continuously for at least 12 months before the transfer of activities to the UK
- be used for exactly the same purpose in the UK
- be appropriate to the nature and size of your business
- be imported from their previous location within 12 months of the date your business ceased activities there

##How to claim relief

Use the correct [Customs Procedure Code (CPC)](/start/trade-tariff.html) [when you make your import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html).

You’ll need to:

- produce evidence to show you’re entitled to this relief
- give HMRC financial security (normally a cash deposit or a banker’s guarantee) to cover the duty and/or VAT before your goods are released

##Records you must keep

You must keep records of:

- the import declaration and the value of the imported goods
- evidence of ownership (if applicable for the relief claimed)
- when, where and how the goods are used
- how the goods are identified - such as manufacturers marks serial numbers, technical descriptions or illustrations
- evidence of disposal

You must keep these records for at least 4 years, even and including after you dispose of the goods.
