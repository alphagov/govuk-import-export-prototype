If you’re a larger company making community transit declarations regularly, it may be worth buying commercial software to make your declarations instead of using NCTS.

Search online for software suppliers.

##Develop your own NCTS software

You can develop software that’s compatible with NCTS, based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML

Contact the NCTS helpline for details.
