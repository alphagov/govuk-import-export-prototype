You don’t usually need to declare when you move goods within the [EU](/eu-eea) or to Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Macedonia or Iceland.

You only need to [make a declaration](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/move-goods-eu/make-declaration.html) if both:

- the goods were originally brought in from outside the EU (or made from materials from outside the EU)
- there’s still duty to pay on them

This declaration is called a ‘community transit declaration’.

##EU special territories, Andorra and San Marino

There are [different rules](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/move-goods-eu/special-territories.html) for moving goods to:

- Channel Islands and other EU special territories
- Andorra and San Marino

%You may have to pay a penalty if you don’t make a declaration when you’re required to.
