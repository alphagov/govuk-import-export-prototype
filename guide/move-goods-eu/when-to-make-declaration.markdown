## Moving goods made in the EU

If your goods are made from EU materials you don’t need to make a community transit declaration to move goods to:

- other EU countries
- countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Macedonia and Iceland

There are [different rules](/guide/move-goods-eu/special-territories.html) for moving goods to the Channel Islands, EU special territories, Andorra and San Marino.

###Goods made from non-EU materials

You must [make a community transit declaration](link to part 2) to move goods to EU or EFTA countries if they:

- were made from materials brought in from outside the EU
- there’s still duty to be paid on them

If the duty has already been paid, they’re in ‘free circulation’ within the EU - so you don’t need to make a Community Transit declaration.

##Moving goods made outside the EU

You must [make a community transit declaration](link to part 2) to move your goods to EU or EFTA countries if:

- the goods were originally brought in from outside the EU
- there’s still duty to pay on the goods

%You may have to pay a penalty if you don’t make a declaration when you’re required to do so.%
