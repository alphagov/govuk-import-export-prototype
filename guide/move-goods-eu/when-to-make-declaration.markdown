You don’t usually need to declare when you move goods within the [EU](/eu-eea) or to Switzerland, Turkey, Norway, Macedonia or Iceland.

You only need to make a ‘community transit declaration’ if both:

- the goods were originally brought in from outside the EU (or made from materials from outside the EU)
- there’s still duty to pay on them

If you need to make a declaration, you can either:

- pay an agent or freight forwarder to do it for you
- [make the community transit declaration yourself](/guide/move-goods-eu/make-declaration.html)

%You may have to pay a penalty if you don’t make a declaration when you’re required to.

##EU special territories, Andorra and San Marino

There are [different rules](/guide/move-goods-eu/special-territories.html) for moving goods to:

- Channel Islands and other EU special territories
- Andorra and San Marino
