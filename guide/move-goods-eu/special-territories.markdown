You only need to [make a community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/make-declaration.html) to move goods to the Channel Islands or other EU special territories if either:


- there’s still duty to pay on the goods, which were brought from outside the EU
- the goods were made from parts or materials brought from outside the EU

Otherwise you don't need to make a declaration.

The EU special territories are:

- Åland Islands (Finland)   
- the Canary Islands
- the Channel Islands
- Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion
- Mount Athos, also known as Agion Poros (Greece)  

##Andorra and San Marino

You must [make a community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/make-declaration.html) if you move:

- any goods to Andorra
- industrial goods to San Marino (these goods are classified in chapters 25 to 97 of the [Trade Tariff](/start/trade-tariff.html))
