You can make a community transit declaration by:

- using or developing software - this is faster and easier for making regular declarations, eg if you're a larger company
- using the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS)
- 
^If you make regular declarations, you can apply to use a simpler declaration process [link to community cosignor content].

##Using software

Search online for software that can send community transit declarations.

### Develop your own software

You can also develop your own software that’s compatible with NCTS based on:

- Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging
- XML
