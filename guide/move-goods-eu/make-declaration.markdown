You must make a community transit declaration if you’re moving [goods that aren’t in free circulation](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html) from the UK to another EU country.

Most businesses use the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to make community transit declarations.

^You can use an agent or freight forwarder to make these declarations for you.^

## Before you start

s1. You will need an EORI (Economic Operator Registration and Identification) number. You can [apply for an EORI number as a VAT registered businesses](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [apply for an EORI number as a business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport).
s2. Sign up to use NCTS on the [Government Gateway website](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/).

You can [check whether your business already has an EORI number](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en) if you’re not sure.

##Make your NCTS declarations simpler

You can apply to use the a simpler declaration processes (link to community cosignor content) if you’re making community transit declarations regularly.
