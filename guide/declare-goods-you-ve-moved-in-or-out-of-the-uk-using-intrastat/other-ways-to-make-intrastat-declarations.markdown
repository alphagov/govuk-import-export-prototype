If you’re a larger company making declarations regularly, it may make sense to use commercial software.

Search online to find software suppliers.

## Develop your own Intrastat software

You can develop software that’s compatible with Intrastat, based on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging.

Contact the [Intrastat helpline](/declare-goods-you-ve-moved-in-or-out-of-the-uk-using-intrastat/get-help-with-intrastat.html) for details.
