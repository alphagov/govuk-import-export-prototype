If you’re a larger company making declarations regularly, it may make sense to use commercial software.

Search online to find software suppliers.

You can develop software that’s compatible with Intrastat, based on Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (EDIFACT) messaging.

Contact the [Intrastat helpline](link to part 4) for details.
