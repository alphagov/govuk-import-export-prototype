You must [make an Intrastat declaration](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/is2/static/is2.html) every month.

Read [guidance on how to complete your declaration](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/AboutIntrastat/Pages/SupplementaryDeclarations.aspx) on the UK Trade Info website.


## What to do if you need to change your declaration

You may need to complete an [amendment form](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/ElectronicSubmission/OnlineAmendments/Pages/OnlineAmendmentsForm.aspx) if you provide incorrect information on your declaration.

## Records you must keep

You must keep:

copies of your Intrastat declarations for 6 years
documents you use to complete your Intrastat declarations

You must let HMRC see your records if they ask.
