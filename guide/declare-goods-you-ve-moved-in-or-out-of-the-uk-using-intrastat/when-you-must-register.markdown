The government uses the Intrastat system to collect international trade statistics from businesses.

You must [register to use Intrastat on the UK Trade Info website](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/
Intrastat/ElectronicSubmission/Internet/Pages/Internet.aspx) if you’re a VAT registered business, and:

you moved more than £250,000 worth of goods to other EU countries in the last calendar year, or
you received more than £1.5 million worth of goods from other EU countries in the last calendar year

When you have registered, you must [make monthly Intrastat declarations](/declare-goods-you-ve-moved-in-or-out-of-the-uk-using-intrastat/make-an-intrastat-declaration.html).

## What counts towards the £250,000 or £1.5 million total

Count the value of goods that are:

bought or sold
hired, loaned or leased
supplied as part of a contract for services
supplied free of charge
moved in or out of the UK to be used in construction
transferred between two branches of your business
sent for processing
sent out of the UK, then lost or destroyed

Only count the value of goods, not services.

Don’t count [goods you’re taking out of the UK temporarily](/).
