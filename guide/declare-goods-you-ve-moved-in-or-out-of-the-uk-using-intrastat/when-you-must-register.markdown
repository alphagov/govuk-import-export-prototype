You must [register for Intrastat](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Intrastat/ElectronicSubmission/Internet/Pages/RegisterforESubmission.aspx) if, in the last calendar year, your business either:

- moved more than £250,000 worth of goods to other EU countries
- received more than £1.5 million worth of goods from other EU countries

^If your business isn’t VAT registered, you don’t need to register for Intrastat.^

When you’ve registered, you must [make monthly Intrastat declarations](/guide/report-moved-goods-intrastat/make-intrastat-declaration.html).

- bought or sold  
- hired, loaned or leased  
- supplied as part of a contract for services  
- supplied free of charge  
- moved in or out of the UK to be used in construction  
- transferred between two branches of your business  
- processed  
- moved out of the UK, then lost or destroyed
