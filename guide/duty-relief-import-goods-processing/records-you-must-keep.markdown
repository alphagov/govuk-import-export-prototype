You must keep records for 4 years after you export the goods. The records must show:

- when and where the goods were imported  
- where the goods were kept at all times  
- how and where the goods were processed  
- where anything made from the goods was kept at all times, and how much was made from the processing (including any waste or by-products)  
- when and where the goods were exported  
- how the goods can be identified when they’ve been processed (or, if you’re using [equivalence](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/store-ipr-goods.html), that they’re exactly the same as the non-IPR goods)
