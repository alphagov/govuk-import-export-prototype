You must process and export most IPR goods within:

- 12 months if you have prior authorisation
- 6 months if you don’t have prior authorisation (or 12 months if you email or fax the National Import Relief Unit when you make your import declaration, telling them that you need 12 months)

If you don’t process and export the goods in time you’ll have to pay the duty and import VAT charges, plus interest.

You can take longer to process some goods, eg aircraft parts. Contact the National Import Relief Unit for details.
