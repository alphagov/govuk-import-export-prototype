You don’t need to get prior authorisation to claim IPR on most goods. Just say that you want to claim IPR when you complete your [import declaration](link to import declaration content).

But you must get prior authorisation if:

- you expect to import goods using IPR regularly (more than 10 times in the next year)
- you’re importing goods that need prior authorisation for IPR

Goods that need prior authorisation for IPR are:

- any goods worth over £500,000
- cereals
- rice
- sugar
- olive oil
- milk or milk products
- tobacco or cigarettes
- alcoholic drinks
- mineral oils
- petrol
- arms and ammunition
- art and antiques
- meat for airline meals
- CFCs or other ozone depleting chemicals
- drug precursor chemicals
- catalysts or goods that are ‘used up’ during processing
- goods you’re importing using a supply balance certificate from the Rural Payments Agency (RPA)
- more than 3,000kg of frozen chicken meat or offal
- more than 7,000kg of pure sucrose in solid form

[Question for SME: should we add other goods to this list - eg eggs, since they’re listed in section 23.1 of notice https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-221-inward-processing-relief/notice-221-inward-processing-relief? Should all goods subject to the economic test be on this list (since, presumably, by definition they can’t use simplified authorisation?]

### Aircraft parts

You don’t need IPR to get relief on import duty when you import civil aircraft parts with a certificate of airworthiness.

Just make an [import declaration](/link) in the usual way.

##Get prior authorisation for IPR

Fill in [form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/400933/ce810.pdf) to apply for prior authorisation. You’ll need the [notes to help you complete form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381441/ce810-notes.pdf).  

You can use form C&E 810 to apply for other duty reliefs or customs warehousing at the same time (called an ‘integrated application’).

[Question for SME: what should people do with completed forms?]

Apply at least 2 months in advance.

For many food and agricultural products, you’ll have to show why you need to import goods from outside the EU. For example, by providing a letter from your customer saying that they insist on it.

### Get prior authorisation for IPR to cover more than one EU country

Apply for a ‘single community authorisation’ if you’re importing goods for processing to more than one European country.

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline to get an application form.

Apply at least 2 months in advance.

### If you can’t get prior authorisation for IPR

You may be able to apply for authorisation after you’ve moved your goods in exceptional circumstances.

For example, you plan to sell a consignment of goods to a customer in the EU. But the customer changes their mind, so you decide at the last minute to export the goods outside the EU instead.

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline for details.
