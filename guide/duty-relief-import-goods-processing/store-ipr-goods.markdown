You can store IPR goods along with other, identical goods using ‘equivalence’.

$E

**Example:** You run a factory that uses nuts to make chocolates. You import some nuts from outside the EU using IPR, and get the rest from inside the EU. Equivalence means that you can store them together, without having to keep track of where individual nuts came from.

$E

You can only use equivalence if you got [prior authorisation](link back to part 2) for IPR.

You can’t use equivalence to allow customers to choose between products made with IPR goods and other products, then re-export the rest.

You can’t use equivalence with EU goods if you applied for IPR because the goods you’re importing aren’t available in the EU.

##Use IPR to help manage your inventory

You can use IPR to help you manage your inventory by substituting ‘equivalent’ goods for goods you’ve imported using IPR.

$E

**Example:** You run a business that repairs broken computers. You get IPR authorisation to import spare parts from outside the EU. Equivalence means you can immediately export a computer that you’ve repaired previously using an equivalent spare part.

$E

$E

**Example:** You sell a computer repaired using IPR parts to a customer in the EU. Equivalence means you can do it without paying duty, because you’ll be exporting equivalent goods in the future.
