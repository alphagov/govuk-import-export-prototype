You don’t have to pay duty or import VAT when you import goods from outside the EU, if you plan to:

process the goods, eg use them to make another product, repair them or repackage them
export the finished product outside the EU

This is called ‘Inward Processing Relief’ (IP relief).

[Note to SME: I haven’t mentioned IP drawback since it’s not going to be available once UCC is implemented in May 2016 (ref s.17 of https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-221-inward-processing-relief/notice-221-inward-processing-relief#ip-drawback]

You’ll need to:

- [get prior authorisation](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/import-goods-using-ipr.html) to import some goods under IP relief
process the goods within the [time limit](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/processing-ipr-goods.html)
- follow the [rules for storing IP relief goods](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/store-ipr-goods.html)
- follow the [rules for exporting or disposing of IP relief goods](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/export-sell-transfer-dispose-ipr-goods.html)
- [keep the correct records](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/records-you-must-keep.html)
