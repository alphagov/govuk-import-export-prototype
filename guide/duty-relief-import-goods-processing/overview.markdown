You don’t have to pay duty or import VAT when you import goods from outside the EU, if you plan to:

process the goods, eg use them to make another product, repair them or repackage them
export the finished product outside the EU

This is called ‘Inward Processing Relief’ (IPR).

[Note to SME: I haven’t mentioned IP drawback since it’s not going to be available once UCC is implemented in May 2016 (ref s.17 of https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-221-inward-processing-relief/notice-221-inward-processing-relief#ip-drawback]

You’ll need to:

- [get prior authorisation](/link) to import some goods under IPR
process the goods within the [time limit](/link)
- follow the [rules for storing IPR goods](/link)
- follow the [rules for exporting or disposing of IPR goods](/link)
[keep the correct records](/link)
