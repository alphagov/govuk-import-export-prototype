When you’ve finished processing the IPR goods and are ready to export the finished product outside the EU, fill in a ‘bill of discharge’. There are two versions: form C99 and form C&E 812.

Fill in [form C99](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/C99&template=C99.xdp) if you imported the goods without getting prior authorisation.

Send the completed form C99 to the National Import Reliefs Unit.

Fill in form [C&E 812](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/CandE812&template=CandE812.xdp) if you got prior authorisation to import the goods. 

Send the completed form C&E 19 to your local supervising office. You can find their contact details on your IPR authorisation.

Then make an [export declaration](/link) in the usual way.

##Sell IPR goods within the EU

Fill in form [C&E 812](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/CandE812&template=CandE812.xdp) if you change your mind about exporting IPR goods outside the EU and want to sell them in the EU.

Send your completed form C&E 812 to your local HMRC supervising office no later than 30 days after the end of the [processing period](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/processing-ipr-goods.html). You can find their contact details on your IPR authorisation.

Then make an [export declaration](/link) in the usual way and pay any duty or import VAT that’s due. You may also have to pay interest.

## Process IPR goods in a customs warehouse

Fill in [form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/400933/ce810.pdf) to apply to process IPR goods in a customs warehouse. You’ll need the [notes to help you complete form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381441/ce810-notes.pdf).

##Transfer IPR goods to someone else with IPR authorisation

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline for advice if you’re transferring IPR goods as one off.

Your local HMRC supervising office can give you permission to use a simplified process if you plan to transfer IPR goods to the same customer regularly. You can find their contact details on your IPR authorisation.

##Destroy IPR goods

You must get permission from HMRC before you destroy IPR goods. Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline for details.
