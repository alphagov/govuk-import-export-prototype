You must get prior authorisation to claim IP relief on most goods.

Fill in [form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/400933/ce810.pdf) to apply for prior authorisation. You’ll need the [notes to help you complete form C&E 810](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381441/ce810-notes.pdf).  

You can use form C&E 810 to apply for other duty reliefs or customs warehousing at the same time (called an ‘integrated application’).

[Question for SME: what should people do with completed forms?]

Apply at least 2 months in advance.

For many food and agricultural products, you’ll have to show why you need to import goods from outside the EU. For example, by providing a letter from your customer saying that they insist on it.

## Get prior authorisation for IP relief to cover more than one EU country

Apply for a ‘single community authorisation’ if you’re importing goods for processing to more than one European country.

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline to get an application form.

Apply at least 2 months in advance.

## If you can’t get prior authorisation for IP relief

You may be able to apply for authorisation after you’ve moved your goods in exceptional circumstances.

For example, you plan to sell a consignment of goods to a customer in the EU. But the customer changes their mind, so you decide at the last minute to export the goods outside the EU instead.

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline for details.
