##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

To move animals within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) you must:

- [apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate](#animal-health-certificate) (ITAHC) for each type of animal
- [check if your animal holding needs to be registered or approved](#register-approve-holding)

###Apply for an ITAHC
{:#animal-health-certificate}

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product, [contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

###Check if your animal holding needs to be registered or approved
{:#register-approve-holding}

As well as an ITAHC, you may also need to register your holding or get it approved before you can move animals in the EU. Your holding is the place you keep your animals in the UK.

You must [register your holding](#register-holding) to move:

- hooved animals (ungulates) that aren’t livestock
- birds that aren’t commercial poultry
- rabbits and hares
- dogs, cats and ferrets that don’t meet the usual rules for [pet travel](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad/overview) (for example rescue animals being rehomed abroad)

You must [get your holding approved](#get-holding-approved) to move:

- any animal to another approved holding
- carnivores or primates, for example monkeys, apes, lemurs
- semen or embryos

You don’t need to register or get approval to move other types of animal.

###Apply to register your holding
{:#register-holding}

Fill in [form EC3163](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501192/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 120KB). Send it to your local [APHA office](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening)  (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

You’ll get a registration number to use on your animal health certificates.

You must get your holding approved before you can move animals to an approved holding.

###Apply to get your holding approved
{:#get-holding-approved}

Fill in [form EC3164](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501199/form-ec3164.pdf) (PDF, 172KB) and send it to your regional veterinary lead (RVL). To find your RVL, contact:

- your [local APHA office](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening)
- [DEARA ](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland

An inspector will arrange a visit to your holding to check that it has:

- walls, fences or other barriers separating it from the surrounding area
- equipment, facilities and staff to catch, confine and isolate animals
- quarantine facilities where you can isolate and test animals that come from non-approved holdings
- a surveillance programme for incoming animals that’s been agreed with your vet
- a clean and separated facility for carrying out post-mortems
- a system for disposing of carcasses that’s been agreed with your vet

You also must make sure you:

- keep records of animals’ age, sex, species, blood tests and diseases
- employ an official veterinarian - contact your local APHA office (or DEARA in Northern Ireland) to find one

###Once your holding is approved

Contact APHA to move animals from your holding. You’ll get an approval number to use on your animal health certificates.

Your holding must be inspected annually. You’ll normally be contacted by your RVL, but it’s your responsibility that the inspection takes place.

Your approval will be suspended if your holding breaks any of the approval conditions or if the RVL finds:

- any [notifiable disease](http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals)
- viral enteritis or aleutian disease in mink
- tuberculosis in apes and non-domestic cats
- European foulbrood, varroasis or acariasis in bees
- myxomatosis, viral haemorraghic disease, tularaemia in rabbits and hares

You’ll be given time to fix the problem - but the RVL can withdraw your approval if you don’t.

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need to apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animals outside the EU.

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. Check the [list of EHCs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Note the EHC number of what you’re exporting.
s3. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get the application form and a copy of the EHC. Tell them the EHC number you require and the details of your official veterinarian.
s4. Fill in the form and the EHC and return them. The address is on the form. 
s5. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check if your products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.
s6. You may need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/local-council). Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

##Transporting animals

You must make sure you meet [animal welfare standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare#animal-welfare-during-transport) when transporting animals.

##Endangered animals

[Search for the animal you’re exporting](http://www.speciesplus.net/). It’s endangered if it’s listed as ‘appendix I’.

Within the EU, you usually can’t move endangered animals except in special cases (like for conservation necessary for the species to survive). [Contact APHA](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

Outside the EU, you need to:

- check the [list of banned exports](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php) - some animals to certain countries are banned outright
- [apply for a CITES permit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB), if the animal isn’t banned

Send the permit application form by post or email to [APHA](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html#contacts) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland), including the [fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355264/cites-ag-ct-01.pdf) (PDF, 146KB).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application.

##Circuses

Within the EU, you must register the circus and its animals if you take them outside the UK. As well as mammals, the rules also apply to any birds, bees, salmon or trout kept for exhibition or entertainment.

Outside the EU, you don’t need to register your circus or its animals. You also don’t need to register circuses within the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

You need a [licence for wild animals](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travelling-circus-with-wild-animals-get-a-licence), even if your circus stays within the UK.

###Registering your circus to travel within the EU

If you take your circus outside the UK to another country in the EU, you must:

- register the circus and animals
- get passports for all animals in the circus or exhibition (apart from bees, salmon or trout) - these are issued by your official veterinarian when you register your circus to travel   
- get an ITAHC before you travel
- keep animals registered as part of the circus away from unregistered animals
- put animals susceptible to rabies into quarantine when they enter the UK – see [rules for domestic animals](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/pet-travel-quarantine) (for other species [contact APHA](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening), or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland)

You must take the following documents with you when you travel:

- passports
- health certificate
- venue register

%It’s an offence to travel with circus animals without registering – you can be prosecuted and fined up to £5,000.%

###Register your circus

Your application must be received at least 40 working days before you want to travel.

s1. Make sure all tests and vaccinations for your animals are up to date. Ensure they all have animal passports.
s2. Choose an official veterinarian to carry out a registration visit - contact your [local APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) to find one. The official veterinarian will charge a fee for this.
s3. Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488776/form-et79.pdf) (PDF, 198KB) and send it to the address on the top of the form. You must include a £93 registration fee and passport fees.
s4. APHA sends the registration document, unique registration number and animal passports to your official veterinarian. 
s5. Your official veterinarian carries out a registration visit. If they’re satisfied with the checks, they’ll approve your application and give you the animal passports, registration document and a unique registration number for your circus or animal act.
s6. You receive a letter from the Centre for International Trade - Carlisle to confirm whether the registration is granted.

You must arrange another official veterinarian visit if you get new circus animals after you’ve registered.

###Animal passport fees

Passports cost:

- £2 for each individual circus animal ([dogs, cats, ferrets](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad/overview) and [horses](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-horses-ponies.html) need special passports)
- £2 for a group of birds or rodents (maximum of 15 ringed or microchipped birds or rodents per group, no limit on the number without rings or microchips)

You need a separate passport for each species and breed.

###Get an ITAHC

You need to apply for an ITAHC at least 10 days before travelling.

s1. Complete an [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) and send it to [Centre for International Trade - Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc). Include details of a nominated official veterinarian with your application. 
s2. APHA sends the health certificate to your official veterinarian to complete.
s3. Your official veterinarian visits you and certifies the health certificate. They’ll give you the ‘consignor confirmation form’. Send this to APHA at least 48 hours before you travel to confirm that all animals in the health certificate are travelling.
