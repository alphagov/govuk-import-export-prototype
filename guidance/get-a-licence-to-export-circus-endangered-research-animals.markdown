##Exporting display, laboratory, and research animals

You must have an animal health certificate to move any of the following:

- simian primates, monkeys and apes
- prosimian primates, eg lemurs, bushbabies, lorises, aye ayes and tarsiers
- ungulates (hooved animals) that aren’t farm animals, eg llamas, alpacas, antelopes, camels, wild pigs, tapirs, rhinos, - giraffes, elephants, hippos
- captive birds and poultry for exhibitions, shows, and contests which aren’t covered by poultry or bird legislation
- honey bees
- jackals, foxes, wolves, African wild dogs, hyaenas
- bears, eg polar, black, brown, grizzly, pandas or giant pandas
- raccoons, coatis, and other new world procyonids
- otters, martens, polecats, badgers, skunks, wolverines
- non-domestic cats like pumas, cheetahs, lions, tigers and leopards
- bats, eg vampire bats, flying foxes, fruit bats, gliders
- flying lemurs and flying squirrels
- marsupials, eg koalas, kangaroos, wombats or wallabies
- possums, bandicoots, bilbys, quolls and Tasmanian devils
- anteaters, sloths, armadillos
- shrews, moles and hedgehogs
- rabbits and hares
- rodents, eg gophers, squirrels, mice, rats, hamsters, voles, beavers, gerbils
- semen or embryos that aren’t bovine or porcine

###Get an animal health certificate

You must ask your vet to do both of the following:

- inspect the animal, semen or embryos before they’re moved
- [complete the health certificates](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/) on the EU Trade Notification System (TRACES)

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

Before the move happens, your vet should also:

- tell [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales
- tell [DARD](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact), if you’re in Northern Ireland

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your licence when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

^You must make sure that animals or semen and embryos travel with their health certificates.^

###Get your holding registered or approved

Whether you need to get your holding registered or approved depends on the animals you want to move and the sites you want to send them to or receive them from.

Your holding will be considered unregistered if you don’t.

###When you need to get your holding registered

You must get your holding registered if you want to trade the following animals with registered or unregistered holdings in the EU:

- ungulates that aren’t livestock
- birds that aren’t commercial poultry
- rabbits and hares
- dogs, cats and ferrets that aren’t pets

Registered holdings can’t trade with approved holdings. 

###Register your holding

To register your holding, [complete form EC3163](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465097/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 120KB) and send it to:

- [your local APHA office](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales
- [your local DARD direct office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) if you’re in Northern Ireland

You’ll be given a registration number which you’ll need to use on your animal health certificates.

###When you need to get your holding approved

You must get your holding approved if you want to trade carnivores or primates, semen or embryos as well as the rest of the animals listed above.

Approved holdings must only take in animals from other approved holdings - [see a list of approved UK holdings](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489501/balai-directive-centres.pdf).

###How to get your holding approved

[Complete form EC3164](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487418/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 172KB) and send it to your regional veterinary lead (RVL).

To find your RVL in England, Scotland and Wales contact your [local APHA office](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening).

Contact your local [DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) to find your RVL if you’re in Northern Ireland.

You must have your holding inspected by an animal health veterinary officer - APHA or DARD will arrange this.

The inspector will check your holding to make sure that it has:

- secure boundaries separating it from the surrounding area, eg walls, fences or other barriers
- equipment, facilities and staff to catch, confine and isolate animals
- quarantine facilities where you can isolate and test animals that come from non-approved holdings
- a surveillance programme for incoming animals that’s been agreed with your vet
- a clean and separated facility for carrying out post-mortems
- a system for disposing of carcasses that’s been agreed with your vet

You must also make sure you:

- keep records of animals’ age, sex, species, blood tests, and diseases
- employ an official veterinarian - contact your local APHA office or your DARD direct office to find one

You’ll be given an approval number to use on your animal health certificates.

###Re-inspection for approved holdings

If your holding is approved, it must pass an annual re-inspection, carried out by a whole-time veterinary officer (WTVO) - they’ll check it still meets the approval conditions.

It’s your responsibility to make sure your holding is annually re-inspected and re-approved, but the WTVO will usually contact you to arrange this.

####When approval gets suspended

If your approval is removed you’ll no longer be able to trade animals with other approved holdings.

####Diseases

Your regional veterinary laboratory (RVL) will temporarily suspend your holding’s approval if they find cases of:

- any [notifiable disease](/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals)
- viral enteritis or aleutian disease in mink
- tuberculosis in apes and non-domestic cats
- European foulbrood, varroasis or acariasis in bees
- myxomatosis, viral haemorraghic disease, tularaemia in rabbits and hares

####Breaking approval conditions
The RVL can also suspend your approval if your holding no longer meets any one of the approval conditions.

####How long suspensions last

The length of time the RVL suspends your approval for depends on the reason for the suspension.

You’ll be given time to fix the problem - if you don’t do this the RVL may withdraw your approval.

####When approval gets withdrawn

If you can’t prove to the RVL that your holding has fixed the problem which led to suspension, your approval may be withdrawn.

Approval for a holding will always be suspended before it’s withdrawn.

###Moving animals from approved holdings to registered holdings
If you want to move animals from an approved holding to a registered holding, you must contact either:

- [APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales   
- your [local DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) if you’re in Northern Ireland


##Exporting circus animals within the EU

You must register the circus and the animals with APHA if you’re exporting the following animals kept for exhibition or entertainment within the EU:

- all mammals (including bats)
- birds
- bees
- salmon
- trout


You don’t need to register when exporting circus animals outside the EU or within Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.


###What you need to do

You must:

- register the circus and animals
- get passports for all animals in the circus or exhibition (apart from bees, salmon or trout) - these are issued by your OV when you register your circus to travel   
- get an ITAHC before you travel
- keep animals registered as part of the circus away from unregistered animals
- put animals susceptible to rabies into quarantine when they enter the UK – see [rules for domestic animals](/guidance/pet-travel-quarantine) (for other species contact APHA)

You must take the following documents with you when you travel:

- passports
- health certificate
- venue register

If your travelling circus has wild animals, you also need to [get a licence](/guidance/travelling-circus-with-wild-animals-get-a-licence).

%It’s an offence to travel with circus animals without registering – you can be prosecuted and fined up to £5,000.%

###Register your circus

Your application must be received at least 40 working days before you want to travel.

s1. Make sure all tests and vaccinations for your animals are up to date.
s2. Choose an OV to carry out a registration visit - contact your [local APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) or [DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) to find one. The OV will charge a fee for this.
s3. Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488776/form-et79.pdf) (PDF, 198KB) and send it to the address on the top of the form. You must include a £93 registration fee and passport fees.
s4. APHA sends the registration document, unique registration number and animal passports to your OV. 
s5. Your OV carries out a registration visit. If they’re satisfied with the checks, they’ll approve your application and give you the animal passports, registration document and a unique registration number for your circus or animal act.
s6. You receive a letter from the Centre for International Trade - Carlisle to confirm whether the registration is granted.

You must arrange another OV visit if you get new circus animals after you’ve registered.

###Animal passport fees

Animal passports cost:

- £2 for each individual circus animal ([dogs, cats, ferrets](/take-pet-abroad) and [horses](/horse-passport) need special passports)
- £2 for a group of birds or rodents (maximum of 15 ringed or microchipped birds or rodents per group, no limit on the number without rings or microchips)

You need a separate passport for each species and breed.

###Get an ITAHC

You need to apply for an ITAHC at least 10 days before travelling.

s1. Complete an [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) and send it to [Centre for International Trade - Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc). You must include details of a nominated OV with your application. 
s2. APHA sends the health certificate to your OV to complete.
s3. Your OV visits you and certifies the health certificate. They’ll give you the ‘consignor confirmation form’. You must send this to APHA at least 48 hours before you travel to confirm that all animals in the health certificate are travelling.


##Export endangered animals

You must apply for a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permit before you export endangered animals. 

Check if the animal you want to export is [controlled by CITES.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.361.01.0001.01.ENG)

^You can’t export certain species to some countries - check the [CITES trade suspension list](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php).^

##Exporting non-domestic ungulates within the EU

You must have an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move some non-domestic ungulates within the EU.

You must keep this document for at least 3 years.

###Using an existing ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must [tell APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487433/form-exa31-livestock.pdf) (PDF, 755KB) and send it to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) - or use [form EXA31 (Poultry)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487438/form-exa31-poultry.pdf) (PDF, 617KB) instead if you're exporting poultry or hatching eggs

###Applying for a new ITAHC

[Contact APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply for a new ITAHC.

You must nominate an OV when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
