There are different guides for:

- [pets](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad/)
- [livestock, poultry and bees](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-livestock-poultry.html)
- [horses and ponies](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-horses-ponies.html)
- [fish and shellfish](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-fish-shellfish.html)

What you need to do to move or export live animals depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

There are additional rules for [circuses](#circuses).


$CTA

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

To move animals within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) you must:

- [apply for a free Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate](#animal-health-certificate) (ITAHC) for each type of animal
- [check if your animal holding needs to be registered or approved](#register-approve-holding)
- follow the rules for [transporting animals](#transporting-animals)

There are different rules for [endangered animals](#endangered-animals).


###Apply for an ITAHC
{:#animal-health-certificate}

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) if you’ve not used it before.
s3. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the live animals you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.
s5. Your certificate will be sent to your official veterinarian once your animals have passed inspection. If your official veterinarian doesn't receive the certificate, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).
s6. Include the certificate when you export your consignment.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your species of animal, [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

###Check if your animal holding needs to be registered or approved
{:#register-approve-holding}

As well as an ITAHC, you may also need to register your holding or get it approved before you can move animals in the EU. Your holding is the place you keep your animals in the UK.

You must [register your holding](#register-holding) to move:

- hooved animals (ungulates) that aren’t livestock
- birds that aren’t commercial poultry
- rabbits and hares
- dogs, cats and ferrets that don’t meet the usual rules for [pet travel](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad/overview) (for example rescue animals being rehomed abroad)

You must [get your holding approved](#get-holding-approved) to move:

- any animal to another approved holding
- carnivores or primates, for example monkeys, apes, lemurs
- semen or embryos

You don’t need to register or get approval to move other types of animal.

$CTA

There’s a different process for animal holdings in Northern Ireland - contact [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

###Apply to register your holding
{:#register-holding}

Fill in [form EC3163](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501192/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 120KB). Send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc). 

You’ll get a registration number to use on your export health certificates.

You must get your holding approved before you can move animals to an approved holding.

###Apply to get your holding approved
{:#get-holding-approved}

Fill in [form EC3164](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/501199/form-ec3164.pdf) (PDF, 172KB) and send it to your regional veterinary lead (RVL). To find your RVL, contact your [local APHA office](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening).

An inspector will arrange a visit to your holding to check that it has:

- walls, fences or other barriers separating it from the surrounding area
- equipment, facilities and staff to catch, confine and isolate animals
- quarantine facilities where you can isolate and test animals that come from non-approved holdings
- a surveillance programme for incoming animals that’s been agreed with your vet
- a clean and separated facility for carrying out post-mortems
- a system for disposing of carcasses that’s been agreed with your vet

You also must make sure you:

- keep records of animals’ age, sex, species, blood tests and diseases
- employ an official veterinarian - you can find one by asking at your local vet, or by emailing <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk> 

###Once your holding is approved

Contact APHA to move animals from your holding. You’ll get an approval number to use on your export health certificates.

Your holding must be inspected annually. You’ll normally be contacted by your RVL, but it’s your responsibility that the inspection takes place.

Your approval will be suspended if your holding breaks any of the approval conditions or if the RVL finds:

- any [notifiable disease](http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals)
- viral enteritis or aleutian disease in mink
- tuberculosis in apes and non-domestic cats
- European foulbrood, varroasis or acariasis in bees
- myxomatosis, viral haemorraghic disease, tularaemia in rabbits and hares

You’ll be given time to fix the problem - but the RVL can withdraw your approval if you don’t.

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need to apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animals outside the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you're exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk>  (or contact [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland)
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). 
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.
s7. Include the certificate when you export your consignment.


There are different rules for [endangered animals](#endangered-animals).

##Transporting animals

You must make sure you meet [animal welfare standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare#animal-welfare-during-transport) when transporting animals.

##Endangered animals

[Use the tool](http://www.speciesplus.net/) to check if your product of animal is listed as an endangered species in the “EU Wildlife Trade Regulations” and the “CITES listing”- if it’s banned outright you can’t export it.

There may also be times when a species is listed in one place but its subspecies is in another list - it will say so in the tool both for the EU (Annex A, B, C and D) and the CITES list (Appendix I,II, III, IV, V).

 | Where it’s listed  | What do you need to do   | In the EU  | outside the EU |
 |---------------- |-------------------------- |---------------|------------ |
 | Annex A of the EU list  | apply for ‘Article 10 certificates’*   | yes   | yes  |
 | Annex B and C of the EU list   | apply for a CITES export permit   | no   | yes  |
 | both Annex D of the EU list and Appendix III in the CITES list  | apply for a CITES export permit | no  | yes  |

You don’t need to apply for ‘Article 10 certificates’ if:

* you’re re-exporting live animals that were bred in captivity - follow the rules of Annex B species instead)
* the animals are in [this list of exeption](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2006R0865:20080225:EN:PDF#page=82).

You usually won't get a certificate for wild bird of prey who are unable to survive in the wild or 'disabled'. You might get permission in execeptional circumstances, for example if your export will benefit conservation or have important educational purposes but [you'll have to provide extra evidence](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362327/cites-gn6.pdf).

##Apply for an ‘Article 10 certificate’

Your application must include supporting documents showing the specimen was acquired or imported lawfully. These could be for:  
* imported specimens a copy of the original import permit stamped by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) or the number of that permit 
* specimens previously issued with an Article 10 certificate, the original yellow copy of the certificate
* a specimen taken from the wild, a copy of any licences issued to allow it to be removed from the wild

Complete your [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use). 


$CTA

Make sure you include your good’s markings correctly (for example it’s tags, microchip numbers or ring number) as this may determine what type of certificate you get. 

If they’re wrong you’re more likely to get a transaction specific certificate instead of a species specific one. This means it only be valid for one sale.

$CTA


### If you don’t have supporting documents

If you don’t have any of the supporting documents, you might still be able to get an Article 10 certificate. 

You’ll need to provide other details of the specimen’s origin, for example:

* details of its parents and the breeder’s name
* parents’ certificate numbers
* a copy of an import certificate confirming the specimens were bred in captivity, or imported or acquired lawfully

###Exporting alien invasive species

If you’re exporting a non-native species which might threaten the environment it is placed in, there are special rules.

You’ll need to fill in a different application if you’re exporting alien invasive species for:

* [research, conversation, scientific or medical use](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/544606/form-ias-permit-article8.pdf)
* [anything else](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/544609/form-ias-permit-article9.pdf)

Send your application to the [centre for international trade in Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)

###Temporary exports 

If you regularly take goods abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, [check if you can use a travelling exhibition certificate](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/pdf/referenceguide_en.pdf) instead of a CITES permit. You can use the certificate whether you're moving goods within or outside the EU.


It applies to items for circuses and menageries.

You can add multiple specimen types in one application if needed.

It is valid for 3 years and means you don't need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​


###Apply

- complete the [application](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-travelling-exhibition-certificate)
- send it to the address on the form

You’ll get your certificate within xx days/weeks and there’s no fee.

[Question for SME: how regularly must you export to qualify for a certificate?]


##Circuses

Within the EU, you must register the circus and its animals if you take them outside the UK. As well as mammals, the rules also apply to any birds, bees, salmon or trout kept for exhibition or entertainment.

Outside the EU, you don’t need to register your circus or its animals. You also don’t need to register circuses within the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.

You need a [licence for wild animals](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travelling-circus-with-wild-animals-get-a-licence), even if your circus stays within the UK.

###Registering your circus to travel within the EU

If you take your circus outside the UK to another country in the EU, you must:

- register the circus and animals
- get passports for all animals in the circus or exhibition (apart from bees, salmon or trout) - these are issued by your official veterinarian when you register your circus to travel   
- get an ITAHC before you travel
- keep animals registered as part of the circus away from unregistered animals
- put animals susceptible to rabies into quarantine when they enter the UK – see [rules for domestic animals](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/pet-travel-quarantine) (for other species [contact APHA](www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening), or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland)

You must take the following documents with you when you travel:

- passports
- export health certificate
- venue register

%It’s an offence to travel with circus animals without registering – you can be prosecuted and fined up to £5,000.%

###Register your circus

Your application must be received at least 40 working days before you want to travel.

s1. Make sure all tests and vaccinations for your animals are up to date. Ensure they all have animal passports.
s2. Choose an official veterinarian to carry out a registration visit. To find an official veterinarian, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk> (or contact [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland). The official veterinarian will charge a fee for this.
s3. Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488776/form-et79.pdf) (PDF, 198KB) and send it to the address on the top of the form. You must include a £93 registration fee and passport fees.
s4. APHA sends the registration document, unique registration number and animal passports to your official veterinarian. 
s5. Your official veterinarian carries out a registration visit. If they’re satisfied with the checks, they’ll approve your application and give you the animal passports, registration document and a unique registration number for your circus or animal act.
s6. You receive a letter from the Centre for International Trade - Carlisle to confirm whether the registration is granted.

You must arrange another official veterinarian visit if you get new circus animals after you’ve registered.

###Animal passport fees

Passports cost:

- £2 for each individual circus animal ([dogs, cats, ferrets](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad/overview) and [horses](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-horses-ponies.html) need special passports)
- £2 for a group of birds or rodents (maximum of 15 ringed or microchipped birds or rodents per group, no limit on the number without rings or microchips)

You need a separate passport for each species and breed.

###Get an ITAHC

You need to apply for an ITAHC at least 10 days before travelling.

s1. Complete an [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) and send it to [Centre for International Trade - Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc). Include details of a nominated official veterinarian with your application. 
s2. APHA sends the health certificate to your official veterinarian to complete.
