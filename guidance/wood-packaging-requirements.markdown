The wood packaging you use to import or export goods must meet certain requirements. Your goods could be rejected or destroyed if you don’t meet these requirements.

Wood packaging includes:

- packing cases
- boxes
- crates
- drums and similar packing
- pallets
- box pallets
- pallet collars
- dunnage (loose wood used to protect goods and their packaging)

^You can use a packing service or freight forwarder to help you meet wood packaging requirements.^

##Import wood packaging

If you import wood packaging from outside the EU, you must make sure it meets the [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 15](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcph004.pdf/$file/fcph004.pdf) (ISPM15). 

If you import wood packaging from inside the EU, it must either:

- meet ISPM15 standards 
- be bark-free or kiln-dried and marked ‘KD’

##Export wood packaging

To export wood packaging inside the EU, you must check that it was produced in the EU and complies with plant health regulations.

[SME question: do users need to provide evidence to show where the packaging was produced?]

If you export wood packaging outside the EU, check if the country you’re trading with accepts ISPM15 and if they have any other requirements. You can either:

- check the [global exporters guide](http://www.timcon.org/ISPM15/ISPM15GlobalGuide.asp)
- contact the country’s embassy or the [National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) in that country](https://www.ippc.int/en/partners/regional-plant-protection-organizations) 

##If your goods fail an inspection

Your wood packaging may be inspected by the Forestry Commission. If your packaging fails an inspection, you’ll have to pay to arrange one or more of the following steps:

- return of the goods
- treatment and marking of the wood packaging to meet ISPM15 requirements
- destruction of the non-compliant wood packaging
- return of the non-compliant wood packaging and, if necessary, the goods associated with it

If you’re given the option to treat the packaging, you can [find a company authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards](http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp).

##Reusing and returning used wood packaging

You can reuse unaltered wood packaging within:

- the EU
- countries that accept ISPM15 

If the wood packaging has been repaired, remanufactured or altered in any way, you must arrange for it to be re-treated and re-marked at an authorised facility. [Find a company authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards](http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp).

###Returning goods to the supplier

You must get a [phytosanitary certificate](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-5cmggk) to return wood packaging to the supplier.
