##Import solid wood packaging

Solid wood packaging must meet the [ISPM15 international standards](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcph004.pdf/$file/fcph004.pdf) (PDF, 197 KB) if you import it from outside the EU.

If you import from the EU (except Portugal), you can specify less strict standards. Packaging can either be bark-free, or have a plant passport if it’s made out of conifer wood. If it’s kiln dried, it must also be marked ‘KD’.

You should specify the requirements for solid wood packaging in your contract with the exporter. This will help protect you if the wood packaging fails an inspection and you're asked to pay for one or more of the following:

- repackaging  of the goods
- treatment and marking of the wood packaging to meet ISPM15 requirements
- destruction of the wood packaging
- return of the wood packaging and, if necessary, the goods inside it

If the packaging fails an inspection and you're given the option to treat it, you can either:

- [find a company authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards](http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp)
- send the wood packaging back to the supplier 

##Export solid wood packaging

If you’re moving packaging inside the EU, check that it complies with EU or [ISPM15 international standards] (http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcph004.pdf/$file/fcph004.pdf)(PDF, 197 KB) - there are [special rules for Ireland and Northern Ireland](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-9QHKKH).

If you export packaging outside the EU, check if the country you’re trading with accepts ISPM15 and if they have any other requirements. 

You can either:

- check the [global exporters' guide](http://www.timcon.org/ISPM15/ISPM15GlobalGuide.asp)
- contact the country’s embassy or [plant protection organisation (NPPO)](https://www.ippc.int/en/partners/regional-plant-protection-organizations)

##Reusing and returning solid  wood packaging

 You can reuse undamaged and uninfested wood packaging in 

- the EU
- countries that accept ISPM15

If ISPM15 compliant  wood packaging has been repaired, remanufactured or changed in any way, you must arrange for it to be re-treated and re-marked to maintain the standard. [Find a company]((http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp)) authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards.
