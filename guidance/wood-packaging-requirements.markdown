Any solid wood packaging you use must meet certain requirements or your goods could be rejected or destroyed.

[Question for SME: do other materials have regulations, eg metal or plastic?]

Wood packaging includes:

- packing cases
- boxes
- crates
- drums and similar packing
- pallets
- box pallets
- pallet collars
- dunnage (loose wood used to protect goods and their packaging)

^You can use a packing service or freight forwarder to help you meet your packaging requirements.^

##Import solid wood packaging

If you import solid wood packaging from inside the EU, check that it:

- meets ISPM15 standards (this is compulsory in Portugal)
- is kiln-dried, marked ‘KD’ and has a plant passport issued by the local forestry commission
- is bark-free (if it contains traces of bark, it must have a plant passport)

If you import solid wood packaging from outside the EU make sure it meets the [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 15](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcph004.pdf/$file/fcph004.pdf) (ISPM15).

##Export solid wood packaging

If you’re exporting packaging inside the EU, check that it  complies with EU or international plant health regulations.
[SME question: do users need to provide evidence to show where the packaging was produced?]

If you export packaging outside the EU, check if the country you’re trading with accepts ISPM15 and if they have any other requirements. You can either:

- check the [global exporters guide](http://www.timcon.org/ISPM15/ISPM15GlobalGuide.asp)
- contact the country’s embassy or the [National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) in that country](https://www.ippc.int/en/partners/regional-plant-protection-organizations)

##If your goods fail an import inspection

Your wood packaging may be inspected by the Forestry Commission. If your packaging fails an inspection, you’ll have to pay for one or more of the following:

- repackaging  of the goods
- treatment and marking of the wood packaging to meet ISPM15 requirements
- destruction of the wood packaging
- return of the wood packaging and, if necessary, the goods inside it

If you’re given the option to treat the packaging, you can [find a company authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards](http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp).

##Reusing and returning solid  wood packaging

 You can reuse undamaged and uninfested wood packaging in 

- the EU
- countries that accept ISPM15

If ISPM15 compliant  wood packaging has been repaired, remanufactured or changed in any way, you must arrange for it to be re-treated and re-marked to maintain the standard. [Find a company]((http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp)) authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards.
