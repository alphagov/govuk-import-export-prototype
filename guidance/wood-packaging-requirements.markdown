Solid wood packaging you use must meet certain requirements or it could be rejected or destroyed.

Packaging products include:

- packing cases
- boxes
- crates
- drums and similar packing
- pallets
- box pallets
- pallet collars
- dunnage (loose wood used to protect goods and their packaging)

You don't need to follow these rules for processed woods like plywood or other packaging materials like cardboard.

##Import solid wood packaging

If you import solid wood packaging from outside the EU or from Portugal, specify in your 'supplier' contract with the exporter that it must meet [International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 15](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcph004.pdf/$file/fcph004.pdf)(ISPM15).

This will help to protect you if the wood packaging you're receiving fails an inspection by the UK Forestry Commission and you're asked to pay for one or more of the following:

- repackaging  of the goods
- treatment and marking of the wood packaging to meet ISPM15 requirements
- destruction of the wood packaging
- return of the wood packaging and, if necessary, the goods inside it

If you’re given the option to treat the packaging, you can [find a company authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards](http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp).

##Export solid wood packaging

If you’re exporting packaging inside the EU, check that it complies with EU or international plant health regulations.
[SME question: do users need to provide evidence to show where the packaging was produced?]

If you export packaging outside the EU, check if the country you’re trading with accepts ISPM15 and if they have any other requirements. You can either:

- check the [global exporters guide](http://www.timcon.org/ISPM15/ISPM15GlobalGuide.asp)
- contact the country’s embassy or the [National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) in that country](https://www.ippc.int/en/partners/regional-plant-protection-organizations)

##Reusing and returning solid  wood packaging

 You can reuse undamaged and uninfested wood packaging in 

- the EU
- countries that accept ISPM15

If ISPM15 compliant  wood packaging has been repaired, remanufactured or changed in any way, you must arrange for it to be re-treated and re-marked to maintain the standard. [Find a company]((http://www.timcon.org/FindASupplier/Default.asp)) authorised to carry out treatment to ISPM15 standards.
