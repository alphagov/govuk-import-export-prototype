You must only import or export rough diamonds to [countries in the Kimberley Process (KP) scheme.](https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/kp-participants-and-observers)

##How to apply

A Kimberley certificate costs Â£37. 

[Question for SME: How long does it take for a certificate to be issued following the application?]

Contact the Government Diamond Office to apply - you must have a certificate before you import or export your goods.

[Question for SME: what does a person do the certificate when they've got it? Attach it to their consignment?
