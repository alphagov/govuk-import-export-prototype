As an approved treatment facility or any other WEEE collection company, you'll need approval if you offer services to export:

- whole electrical and electronic appliances for reuse overseas
- materials extracted from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) to be treated, recovered or recycled overseas

You can only export whole appliances that you received from a producer compliance scheme (PCS).

$CTA
If you export outside the [EEA](/eu-eea), the treatment or recovery site must operate to the [equivalent standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/receiving-exported-waste-meeting-eu-equivalent-standards) of an authorised treatment facility (ATF) in the UK.

##Apply to be an approved exporter

Download and fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312450/LIT_7337.pdf) (PDF, 433KB)

Print and send your application to the appropriate UK regulator - the address is on the form.

The fee for applying is £500, or £2,570 if you’ll export more than 400 tonnes of WEEE.

You must usually apply 12 weeks before you want approval to start. For approvals to start on 1 January, apply by 30 September.

Your approval lasts for one year. You'll need to apply again if you continue to export WEEE.



##Once you've got approval

When you export WEEE, you should also:

- for whole appliances, issue an [evidence note and document how much WEEE is recycled](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weee-evidence-and-national-protocols-guidance/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee-evidence-and-national-protocols-guidance) - if you offer this as a service
- [make quarterly returns and keep records](#reporting)
- complete a [waste transfer note](https://www.gov.uk/managing-your-waste-an-overview/waste-transfer-notes)

You may also need to follow the rules for [transporting dangerous goods](https://www.gov.uk/shipping-dangerous-goods) and [hazardous waste](https://www.gov.uk/dispose-hazardous-waste).

###Make quarterly returns and keep records 
{:#reporting}
If you get approval, you must make quarterly returns.

Include the amount in tonnes of WEEE exported:

- in total
- for treatment, recovery or recycling or reuse as a whole appliance 

[question for SME - is it correct that you can only export WEEE for treatment, recovery or recycling or reuse as a whole appliance? If so, why does someone need to report this as a separate figure from the total exported - ie how could the amounts be different?]

For both, specify:

- the waste category 
- whether it's household or non-household waste
- the producer compliance scheme (PCS) it was from

Also include the amount in tonnes of:

- WEEE to each scheme you gave evidence notes to, and the scheme names
- any non-obligated WEEE (this means not from a PCS) you exported by category

Send them to the environmental regulator that confirmed your approval by the deadline.


| Quarter | Months covered              | Deadline for reporting |
|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| 1       | January, February, March    | 30 April            |
| 2       | April, May, June            | 31 July             |

| 4       | October, November, December | 31 January          |

You should also [keep records](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weee-evidence-and-national-protocols-guidance/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee-evidence-and-national-protocols-guidance#aatfs-and-aes-keeping-records) of documents to support your evidence notes for at least 4 years. You may need them as part of a compliance audit.

##If you need help

Contact the environmental regulator that you sent your application form to. Their address is on the form.
