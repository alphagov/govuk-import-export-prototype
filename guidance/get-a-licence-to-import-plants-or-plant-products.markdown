You only need an import licence to receive plants, seeds and soil from the EU if they're [prohibited](#importing-prohibited-plants-and-soil-for-research).

##Importing plants outside the EU

If you’re importing plants outside the EU, you’ll need a certificate for ‘controlled’ plants, like:

* plants for planting
* cut flowers
* some seeds 

If you’re unsure if your plant or seeds are controlled, [check the list](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/429934/plant-imports-categories.pdf). 

There are different rules, if you’re travelling with them and they’re for [personal use](https://www.gov.uk/bringing-food-animals-plants-into-uk/pets-and-other-animals).

If you’re importing ‘prohibited plants’ for scientific research or any other reason, [you'll need a licence](#importing-prohibited-plants-and-soil-for-research).

##Importing 'controlled' plants

To import ‘controlled’ plants, you need to:

s1. Register as an importer.
s2. Make sure your goods have a plant health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’). 
s3. Notify the government before the goods arrive.
s4. Get the goods inspected
s5. Send the original copy of your certificate once the goods have arrived


###Registering as an importer  

[Register for PEACH](http://ehmipeach.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Module=Register).

###Make sure your goods have a plant health certificate

‘Controlled plants’ must travel with a phytosanitary certificate -this will be issued by the local plant authority in the country you’re importing from.

It’s your responsibility to speak to the exporter and the authorities in their country to make sure the details on the certificate are understood in the UK.

You need to make sure that the quantities on it are described:

* in stems for cut flowers
* by weight (in kilograms) for seeds, soil, branches with foliage, bulbs, corms, rhizomes and plants in tissue culture
* as the number of units for any other planting plants

You must scan the certificate and upload it to PEACH before your goods arrive or, attach certified copies of the certificates to each package if you’re travelling with them.

###Notifying customs about your goods

Use PEACH to notify customs at least:

* 4 hours before your goods arrive if they’re coming by plane between 8:30am and 5pm on a working day
* 3 working days before they arrive if they’re coming in by ship

You also need to attach:

* proof that the goods moved, eg a bill of lading, cargo movement request or delivery company invoice.

* This [spreadsheet](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/importing-plant-material-record-of-details) with details of your plants

###Getting your goods inspected

Your good must be inspected when they enter the UK. They can only be inspected at these [‘points of entry’](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479079/plant-imports-points-of-entry.pdf).

You can also arrange to have your goods inspected at alternative locations if you’re putting your goods into an external storage facility or using a simplified customs process[link to getting your goods through customs faster].

###Fees

You need to pay £5.71 to make sure your goods have the correct documents.

You need to pay between £5.71 and £11.42 (depending on the size of the consignment) to make sure you’ve imported all the plants you said you would. 

You need to pay another fee to check the health of your plant, [the price will vary depending on your goods](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/601/schedule/1/made) - you might be eligible for a [reduced fee](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1996/regulation/4/made).

If your goods don’t come in on a working day, you have to pay more, you’ll have to indicate you want to do this in your PEACH account.

###Send an original copy of your certificate
Within 3 days of your consignment reaching the UK, you must post the original phytosanitary certificate to APHA.

For consignments landing at Heathrow or Gatwick send the certificate to:

Animal and Plant Health Agency 
10th Floor  
Vista Centre  
50 Salisbury Road   
Hounslow   
TW4 6JQ   


For consignments landing anywhere else send the certificate to:

Animal and Plant Health Agency   
Room 11GA02   
Sand Hutton   
York   
YO41 1LZ



If your consignment travelled through another EU member state, the phytosanitary certificate will have been replaced with a ‘plant health movement document’. Send that instead.

##Importing prohibited plants and soil for research

If you’re importing certain plants which are banned, you can only bring them into the UK (with a licence) for :

* scientific research or trials
* testing new varieties of plants (varietal selection)
* if AHPA have agreed to an exception (‘derogation’)

[Check Annexe III](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:169:0001:0112:EN:PDF) to find the list of plants.

If you’re importing plants which aren't on this list but that you can’t get an phytosanitary certificate for (eg plants collected from the wild), you should also get a licence.

###Prohibited soil

You must have a licence to import, move, or keep soil from all countries outside Europe, apart from:

* Belarus
* Moldova
* Russia
* Turkey
* Ukraine

This also applies to any organic material which is capable of sustaining plant life and which contains solid organic matter, eg humus, peat other than pure and unused peat, moss and bark.

You don’t need a licence for:

* marine sediments
* pure and unused peat
* pure sand, clay, talc, rocks, volcanic pumice and chalk
* water that isn’t contaminated by soil or organic matter

You must have a licence for artificial growing product containing organic matter, (unless it’s made up entirely of unused peat).

##Apply for a licence

[Register for eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx) and sign in to start your application.

You must give details of: 

* the security of your testing sites
* how you’ll keep records of your imports
* the layout of your facilities
* the procedures you’ll follow during experiments

##Fees

Licences for plants cost £793.03. 

This fee covers a licence for 5 types of material - you must pay a further £31.20 for each extra type of material.

Licences for prohibited soil or other organic material cost £572.02.

APHA will send you an invoice after you apply for a licence using the eDomero system.

###What to do with you licence

When you receive your licence it will have a 'letter of authority' attached to it, you must keep this.

You must also

s1. Send a copy of your letter to the exporter
s2. If they're in the EU - ask them to get your letter endorsed by their National Plant Protection Organisation (NPPO) 
s3. Ask them to include a copy of the letter inside and outside each package

##Once the consignment arrives

The goods must go directly to the 'quanrantine containment facility' detailed on your licence.

You must contact AHPA to inspect your goods once they arrive and keep them in quarantine until you do.

The first inspection will be covered in the cost of your licence and the inspector will tell you how often you need to be inspected (most licenses will require reinspection every 2 or 3 years). 

If you fail the inspection, you will have to pay £42.75 an hour for another inspection.
