What you need to do to export livestock and poultry depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

There are different rules for [bees](#exporting-bees).

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

You must have an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move livestock or poultry within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea).

If you export poultry, you must also join the [Poultry Health Scheme](#poultry).

###Apply for an ITAHC
{:#animal-health-certificate}

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your livestock. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection. You must keep it for 3 years.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

To export livestock or poultry outside the EU you must apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC).

###Apply for an EHC
{:#export-health-certificate}

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you're exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet, or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to you within xxx days/weeks.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). 
s6. If you’re exporting poultry, check your EHC. It’ll say if you need to join the [Poultry Health Scheme](#poultry).
s7. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

[Questions for fact check: How long does it usually take to get a EHC? Is there a fee?]

###Exporting outside the EU via another EU country
{:#via-eu}

If your consignment will travel through the EU on the way to a non EU country, you may need both an [ITAHC]({#animal-health-certificate}) and an [EHC](#export-health-certificate).

Look at each stage of the journey and make sure your consignment has the right certification for each.

##Poultry
{:#poultry}

You must be a member of the Poultry Health Scheme (PHS) to export:

- within the EU (unless you’re exporting 20 birds or hatching eggs or less)
- outside the EU to certain countries - your EHC will say if you need to join the scheme

To join the PHS, contact APHA.
