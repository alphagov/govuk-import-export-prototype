##Exporting livestock within the EU

You must have an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move the following animals within the EU:

- cattle
- sheep and goats
- pigs
- poultry 

You must keep this document for at least 3 years.

###Use an existing ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487433/form-exa31-livestock.pdf) (PDF, 755KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) - use [form EXA31 (Poultry)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487438/form-exa31-poultry.pdf) (PDF, 617KB) instead if you're exporting poultry or hatching eggs

###Applying for a new ITAHC

[Contact APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply for a new ITAHC.

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

##Exporting livestock outside the EU

You must get an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export livestock outside the EU. You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of authorities in the destination country, and any other requirements they may have.

###Get an existing EHC issued

There will usually already be an EHC for the type of livestock you’re exporting and where you’re exporting it to.

Check the [List of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB) to see if the EHC you need already exists and is available for issue.

If the certificate you want already exists, and is available for issue, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) and ask them to send you an application form and a copy of the EHC.

You must complete the application form and the EHC as fully as you can and send it back to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).

###Nominate an OV

You must nominate an OV when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

To find an OV, you can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

In some cases, there won’t be an available EHC that covers the type of consignment you want to send and the destination you’re sending it to.

This could be because:

- the EHC you want is on hold - eg due to a trade ban enforced by the destination country
- there hasn’t been any previous demand for an EHC for the animal you’re exporting to the destination country
- negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing - agreeing new EHCs can take years or stall due to trade barriers

If the EHC you want doesn’t exist, you should talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

You should send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) who will pass the details to Defra for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.

##Exporting livestock through the EU to a non-EU country

If your consignment will travel through the EU on the way to a non EU country, you may need both an [ITAHC](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-livestock-poultry.html#exporting-livestock-within-the-eu) and an [EHC](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-livestock-poultry.html#exporting-livestock-outside-the-eu).

You should look at each stage of the journey and make sure your consignment has the right certification for each.

##Exporting poultry

You must be a member of the Poultry Health Scheme (PHS) if you want to export:

- more than 20 birds or hatching eggs to another EU member state (as long as your business meets EU animal health and welfare rules)
- export to certain countries - your EHC will state whether you need to be a member

You must have had your flock for more than 6 weeks to export live poultry and hatching eggs to another EU country.

You can find more information on the scheme in the [Poultry Health Scheme members handbook (PDF, 538KB)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/377556/phs-handbook.pdf), including inspections, biosecurity and facility regulations.
