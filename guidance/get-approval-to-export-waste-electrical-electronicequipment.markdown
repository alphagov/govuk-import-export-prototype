You’ll need to [get approval](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312450/LIT_7337.pdf) to be an exporter of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) such as TVs, keyboards, fridges and mobile phones.

You’ll also need to apply for a notification control for most countries outside the EU.

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

###Record keeping

If you get approval, you must make quarterly returns from January to 30 April, from May to 31 July, from August to 31 October and from November to 31 January.

Send them to the environmental regulator that confirmed your approval. They must say how much WEE you exported:

* in tonnes 
* for reuse as a whole appliance, treatment, recovery or recycling

For each specify what the category is and whether or not it was household waste - you also need to say which schemes you’ve sent evidence notes to.

Keep proof like:

* photographs, invoices and receipts
* shipping paperwork 
* contracts

##If you’re exporting WEEEs to be reused

If you’re exporting whole electrical goods to be recycled or reused you must make evidence notes.

Sign up for the [Settlement Centre](https://www.weee-sc.org.uk/) or [log in](https://www.weee-sc.org.uk/login.aspx) to create the notes.

###Meeting recycling targets 

If you’re exporting WEEE you must make sure the importer is meeting recycling targets.

These will be between 55% and 80% depending on the category. [Use this template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488880/LIT_10353.xlsx) to document the percentage of WEEE they recover.

If you don’t send evidence notes and meet recycling targets, your approval may be suspended or cancelled

##Check if you need a notification control

[Use the tool](http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/waste-import-export/124357.aspx) to find out which controls apply to you.

You must also create a contract between you and the business you're sending waste to before you ship it.

###Apply for notification controls

s1. Register for [International Waste Shipments (IWS)](https://international-waste-shipments.service.gov.uk/registration/applicant-registration) and start your application.
s2. Download and complete the financial guarantee (this must be accepted before you ship the waste).
s4. If your waste is going to another location to be stored or processed before it arrives at its final destination, [attach a completed an interim operation form](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/shipments/pdf/correspondents_guidelines3_en.pdf)or 'movement document'.
s5. Make sure a copy of the notification control and all supporting documents travels with your goods.

[Question for SME: Can the movement document and the interim form be found within the online service? How to users know their financial guarantee has been accepted?]

You may need to get insurance before you submit your application as the importing country may ask to see it.

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html)

$CTA

If you haven't heard back from the Environment Agency within 30 days of submitting your application, email askshipments@environment-agency.gov.uk.

###How long it lasts

You’ll have 1 year to ship your goods before your ‘notification control’ expires unless the site you're exporting to has pre-consent status. If they do, your control could last up to 3 years.

###Fees

You must pay a fee for this service.

The minimum fee for a 'recovery' shipment is £1,450 (for example if you’re recycling the waste) and maximum cost is £14,380 for over 500 shipments. You'll be told the exact fee in your notification control application.

[Question for SME: Will they be sent an invoice?]

You can apply for a refund from the Environment Agency if you:

* don't send the goods within 12 months
* if your notification control is rejected 
* if you withdraw your application before you get an answer

###Increase the number of waste shipments

If you’d like to increase your exports without applying for a new control:

* send the written request to the Environment Agency before any extra shipments take place
* get written consent for your extra shipments from the importing country’s competent authorities’ (their contact details are listed in your notification control application)
* not exceed the maximum tonnage detailed in your notification document

Send your request to:


International Waste Shipments Team    
Environment Agency   
Richard Fairclough House   
Knutsford Road    
Warrington   
WA4 1HT
