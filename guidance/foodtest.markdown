##Processed foods
{:processed-foods}

Within the EU, you don't need a licence or follow special rules to move processed foods.

Outside the EU, check with the country you're exporting to. They'll tell you if you need a 'certificate of free sale'.

If you're exporting  processed fish products to Australia or New Zealand

###Apply for a certificate of free sale

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484867/COFSApplicationExportNonEU_v2.0.doc) (MS Word Document, 127KB).

Send it to <trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk>. You’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.)

###If you need help

Contact the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).

**Rural Payments Agency**         
Telephone: 03000 200 301  
Monday to Friday: 8.30am to 5pm  
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)      

##Unprocessed animal products
{:#unprocessed-animal-products}

You need a certificate to export unprocessed animal products that will be used as food, for example:

- meat and fish
- dairy
- honey
- gelatine, lard or blood

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#unprocessed-animal-products-within-EU) or [outside the EU](#unprocessed-animal-products-outside-EU).

$CTA

There are different rules for animal products that will be used as [food for animals].

$CTA

###Within the EU
{:#meat-dairy-animal-products-within-EU}

You need to apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) for each type of animal product that you’re moving within the EU.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product, [contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

###Outside the EU
{:#unprocessed-animal-products-outside-EU}

You need to apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export unprocessed animal products outside the EU.

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. Check the [list of EHCs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Note the EHC number of what you’re exporting.
s3. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get the application form and a copy of the EHC. Tell them the EHC number you require and the details of your official veterinarian.
s4. Fill in the form and the EHC and return them. The address is on the form. 
s5. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check if your products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.
s6. You may need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

##Vegetables, fruit and other plants used as food
{:#plants}

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#plants-within-EU) or [outside the EU](#plants-outside-EU).

###Within the EU
{:#plants-within-EU}

You don't need to follow special rules for plants unless you either need:

- a plant passport
- a supplier document

###Check if you need a plant passport
Some plants need a plant passport - for example apples, citrus fruits, hops and beets. Check the [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446525/plant-passports-plant-products.pdf) (PDF, 212KB) and [regions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446531/plant-passports-protected-zones.pdf) (PDF, 108KB) where you need one.

Seed potatoes always need a plant passport when moved around the UK or the EU. They must be part of the [Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme).

If you’re exporting to Switzerland, there are different [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447496/plant-passports-switzerland-1.pdf) (PDF, 108KB) and [regions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447499/plant-passports-switzerland4.pdf) (PDF, 201KB) that need a 
passport.

###Check if you need a supplier document

Check if your [fruit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446540/plant-passports-fruit-plants.pdf) or [vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446542/plant-passports-veg-plants.pdf) need a supplier document.

You don't need a supplier document if both:

* your goods are for retail sale
* you're a small producer selling to the local market - you must sell your produce within a 50 metres radius of your site and mark it 'for direct sale to the public only'.

If you’re not sure, contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices).

###Apply for a plant passport or supplier document

Contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices) if you need a plant passport or supplier document to travel with your goods. They can also tell you what to do if you want to create your own.

You’ll have to have an inspection and  pay £46.10 for every 15 mins that an inspection takes, (including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site).

The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. 

You have to pay these fees again if you need more plant passports the next year.

There is no charge for supplier documents 

[Question for SME: How much is the charge to have a passport and can you have a supplier document made for you?]

###Outside the EU
{:#plants-outside-EU}

Most countries require you to have a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) if you export fruit, vegetables or other plants to be used as food. 

Check with the country that you’re exporting to find if you need a certificate.

There are different rules for [grain](#grain).

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

###Apply for a plant health certificate

Unless you're part of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme), you must apply for your plants to be tested before you get a plant health certificate.

Apply by filling in the appropriate form for:

* [potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)   
* other [plants, including fruit and vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    
* plants from [outside the EU that were stored, repacked, or split up](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf)

Return the completed form to [your local APHA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).

Your plants will be tested. If they pass, you’ll get your certificate in 7 days. It usually costs £13.87 for the plant health certificate and £36.35 for a lab inspection.

You can contact APHA to check whether you need:

- a soil inspection for the plants you're exporting - use the [soil inspection form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling) if you do
- to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export - the USA, New Zealand and other countries require this

[Question for SME: Do you growing season inspections also apply to food?]
[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]

If your soil needs to be tested, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes of inspection time. There's a minimum fee of £99.36.

[Question for SME: Does the inspection fee include a certificate or do you need pay a certificate fee on top of that?]

###Reduced fees for small businesses

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5,000 in the last financial year

##Grain
{:#grain}

Check the table of countries for whether you need a [plant health certificate](#plant-health-certificate-grain) to export grain outside the EU.

The table also shows if you need:

- to send a sample for testing when you apply for your certificate
- an import permit - get this from the country you're exporting to

###Apply for a plant health certificate for grain
{:#plant-health-certificate-grain}

s1. If you need one, apply for an import permit from the country you're exporting to.
s2. Fill in the [plant health certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Only fill in sections 1 and 2 if you need to send a sample. 
s3. Return the form to [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) 5 days before you want to export. 
s4. If required, include a 1kg sample when you return your application form. For Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, China or Vietnam, send a second 1 kg sample in a paper bag sealed inside a plastic bag.
s5. Contact the port you’re exporting from to arrange for a trade inspector to inspect your grain.
s6. When you've passed your inspection, fill in another copy of the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf).

[Question: What is the second application form in step 6 for? Where does the user have to send it?]


[Question for SME: Do users need to know about the country specific tests for Cuba and Vietnam or will the inspectors know what to test for according to the destination country?]

If you fail the inspection, you’ll need to have your grain treated by a professional company. This usually takes 10 to 20 days, but you may be able to get your grain treated in transit.

Sometimes you’ll also need a declaration to add to your plant certificate to prove you’ve tested for certain pests. This is required in:

* Hungary for acarus siro L  
* Vietnam for tilletia indica (karnal bunt) only  
* Kyrgyzstan for tilletia indica and Trogoderma granarium

[Question for SME: Do APHA provide these automatically? It’s not on the form]


###Fees

You must pay:

* £59.53 to get phytosanitary certificates
* £59.53 for a trade inspector to inspect your grain
* £59.53 to APHA, if you need to send a sample

Small exporters are eligible for a [discounted fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-export-services-application-for-concessionary-rates).

##Sugar, cereals and rice
{:#sugar}

If you’re exporting these goods outside the EU in [large quantities](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections) you need a 'mandatory export licence'.

###Apply for a mandatory export licence

s1. Call the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to get a trader registration number .
s2. Fill in the [application form - needs correct link].
s3. Pay a [security deposit](#security-deposit).
s4. Your licence will be issued on the CHIEF system within 5 days and will appear when you make your declaration (link to declaration content). You can also ask for a paper one if the countries you're trading with require this.

If you want to send your application by email rather by than fax or post you need to [get approval] [needs correct link].

If you'd like to cancel or amend your application you must do this before 12pm on the day you apply.

You can export 105% of the quantity you put on the form without having to get a new licence.

###Calculate your security rate
{:#security-deposit}

Your security rate for rice and cereals is 3 euros per tonne.

Check the table to see how much you need to pay for sugar.

| sugar commodity code | security rate for 100 kilos |
|------------------------|------------------|
| 1701 | €11 |
| 1702, 2106 and 1702 6095 | €4.2 |
| 1703 (molasses) | €0.9 |
| 1702 6080 (inulin syrup) | €8 |
| 1701 (non-quota sugar) |  €0.3 |
| 1702 9080 (inulin syrup) | €0.6|

You don’t need to pay a security if you meet the conditions of your licence and one of the following applies:

* your total comes to €100 or less
* your total comes to €500 [or less?] but you commit to paying any invoices sent by the RPA if the conditions of your licence arn't  met.[link to form]
* you're a humanitarian organisation exporting goods for aid 

[Question for SME: Is there a version of the €500 form which isn’t embedded within the leaflets? It seems that calling RPA to get the words might not be that efficient?]

###How to pay 

You can pay:

* in a single payment in [pounds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439547/fdgs6t_-_IX6S_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 132KB) or [euros](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439546/fdgs13_-_IX6U_-_V4.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 159KB)

* in a group or 'block' payment in [pounds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439549/fdgs7t_-_IX7_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 101KB) or [euros](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439544/fdgs10t_-_IX5U_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 43.2KB)

* by cash, cheque, banker's draft or any other payments agreed by RPA 

If you choose block payments you should get statements from RPA to tell you how much you still owe. You can commit to the block payments as a [group of traders](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439549/fdgs7t_-_IX7_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 51.7KB). You can also apply to [change the name](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439550/fdgs5_-_IX8_-_v5.0_Jun_2015.pdf) (PDF, 65.3KB) on the 'contract'.

Pay your security to:

Bank: RBS (NatWest)  
Sort code: 60-70-80  
Account number: 550/00/85014583  
BIC: NWBKGB2L  
IBAN: GB48 NWBK 6072 0385 0145 83  

###Getting your security back

Your security will be refunded in full if you export at least 95% of the quantity on the licence within 2 months of its expiry date - this will happen automatically if you used CHIEF.

If you're using a paper licence, you'll need to return it to the RPA within 2 months of its expiry with any supporting documents and your securities will usually be returned to you within 21 days of receiving your proof.

If you're late or fail to do this, you won't get your full security back or won't get it back at all.

If you use your licence in stages, you can ask us for the security in stages, as long as you can prove that at least 5% of the total quantity has been imported or exported.

###If you need help

Contact the RPA if you need help with CAP good exports.
