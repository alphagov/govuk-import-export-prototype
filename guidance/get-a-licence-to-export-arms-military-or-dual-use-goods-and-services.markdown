Whether you need a licence depends if:

* your goods are listed as a dual use or military (this covers both physical goods and skills or services like technical assistance including repairs or maintenance)
* you’re exporting inside or outside the EU  - the rules are less strict for ‘dual-use goods in the EU
*  your goods aren't on the ‘consolidated list’ but could still be used for military purposes
* your goods are banned (or if you were planning to send them to a embargoed country)

‘Dual use’ items include goods, technology, documents or diagrams which meet certain technical standards and could be used for military or civilian purposes (for example nuclear materials; chemical agents, telecommunications, lasers, or machine tools; navigation equipment; aerospace ).

##If your goods are listed as “Schedule 3 UK controlled ‘dual-use, software and technology”

This refers to ‘dual use’ goods, services and technologies and you:

* won’t need a licence for most goods you move around most EU countries, [unless their ‘end use’ might be dangerous](#moving-dual-use-goods-within-the-EU)

* will need a licence outside the EU

###Moving ‘dual-use’ goods within the EU

You won’t need a licence to move most ‘dual-use’ goods within the EU (apart from Latvia where you always need one).

In certain countries, whether you need one or not will depend on its 'end use'.

You’ll need a licence if something you’re exporting might be used for military purposes in an arms embargoed country. For example:

- components that will be used to make weapons
- goods, services or technology that might be used to make Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) (for example, chemicals or biological agents or technology that might be used in a nuclear weapons facility)

You must [contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO)](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#contact-the-export-control-organisation-eco) if your goods could have a dangerous use and are being moved to:

Austria, Bulgaria ,Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Romania, Spain.

##If your goods are listed as any other category 

You will need a licence inside and outside the EU

##Exporting goods that aren’t on the consolidated control lists

You must also  [contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO)](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#contact-the-export-control-organisation-eco) if you find out that something you’re exporting might have a dangerous 'end user' or may be used to make WMDs.

There is advice available within the Spire application system about end-users.

You must apply for an export licence if ECO tells you to.

##Military goods you can’t export

There’s a complete ban on exporting:

- anti personnel landmines, and parts or components for anti personnel landmines
- blinding laser weapons
- man-portable air defence systems (MANPADs) to end users who aren’t states
- non-civil nuclear supplies or materials to a country that’s not one of the other recognised nuclear weapons states (United States, Russia, France and China)

###Countries you can’t usually export to

ECO won’t usually give a licence if there’s an embargo on exporting military goods. 

Arms embargoed countries are:

- Argentina (if the goods will be used by the Argentine military)
- Armenia and Azerbaijan (if the goods could be used on the border between the two countries, or in the Nagorno-Karabakh region)
- Belarus
- Democratic Republic of Congo
- Eritrea
- Iran
- Iraq - if the end-use is military
- Ivory Coast
- Lebanon
- Libya
- North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)
- Republic of Guinea
- Russia
- Sierra Leone
- Somalia
- South Sudan
- Sudan
- Syria
- Zimbabwe

There are some limited exceptions (eg for some types of goods that will be used for humanitarian relief or peacekeeping).

[Question for SME: how would we describe the limited exception that exists for Sierra Leone?]

ECO won’t usually give a licence to export small arms, light weapons, weapon components or ammunition to:

- Benin
- Burkina Faso
- Cape Verde
- The Gambia
- Ghana
- Guinea Bissau
- Liberia
- Mali
- Niger
- Nigeria
- Senegal
- Togo

##Apply for an export licence

[Use the OEGL checker](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/) to see if you can get a existing licence.

If you can’t there, are other types of licences you can apply for.

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for all types of export licences.

The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

###How ECO decides whether to give licences

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.

ECO also looks at the ‘[incorporation factors](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020708/text/20708w01.htm#column_652)’ if the goods will be incorporated into military equipment which will then be exported to another country.

Decisions are partly based on where you’re exporting to.

##Taking military and dual use goods out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take military and dual use goods out of the country temporarily (eg to demonstrate them to potential buyers at a trade show or take them to a commemorative military event).

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

## Trafficking, brokering and arranging sales or movements

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the consolidated military list or ‘dual-use’ terms that may be intended for a weapon of mass destruction end use. 

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one country to another. For example:

- arranging or negotiating sales
- providing freight or insurance
- providing financial or legal advice
- arranging intra company transfers
- drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.


##Your licence responsibilities

You are responsible for making sure that your licence is still valid when you export the goods.

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your licence when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/).

ECO carries out regular compliance visits to licence holders.

The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

- what records to keep
- what compliance processes to put in place
- how to train staff
- how compliance audits work

You can also find out what rules apply to each licence:

- [OEGL licences](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/464587/15-225-ogel-military-goods.pdf)

[Are there publications for the other licences? How do users find out about them?]

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could face a fine or prison sentence.

###Sharing classified information

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means:

- information or equipment classified as [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- information or equipment classified as ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

It’s not just exporters and potential exporters who must apply approval. The rule applies to anyone sharing classified information (for example, academics and researchers).

[Question for SME: does it apply to anyone - eg journalists?]

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.
