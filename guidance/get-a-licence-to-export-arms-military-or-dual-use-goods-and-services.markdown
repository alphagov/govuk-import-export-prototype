You must have a licence to sell military or 'dual use' goods, services and technologies overseas, or to share classified information with someone based overseas. This applies whether you're exporting within or outside the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea).

$CTA

[Check the consolidated control lists using the Goods Checker tool](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to see if you need a licence.

$CTA

Military or dual use items can be raw materials, components or finished systems.

The consolidated control lists include:

- weapons
- goods, technology or services or components designed or modified for military use (for example Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, aircrew life support equipment, imaging equipment, cryptographic technology, self contained diving and underwater swimming apparatus or training materials for a weapons system)
- ‘dual use’ items - goods, technology, documents or diagrams which meet certain technical standards and could be used for military or civilian purposes (for example chemical agents, telecommunications, lasers or machine tools)
- the transfer of knowledge and skills that could be used for military purposes

$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Exporting goods that aren’t on the consolidated control lists

You must [contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO)](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#contact-the-export-control-organisation-eco) if you find out that something you’re exporting might be used for military purposes in an embargoed country, even if it doesn’t appear on the consolidated control lists. For example:

- components that will be used to make weapons
- goods, services or technology that might be used to make Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) (for example, chemicals or biological agents or technology that might be used in a nuclear weapons facility)

These are called ‘end use’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

You must apply for an export licence if ECO tells you to.

##Military goods you can’t export

There’s a complete ban on exporting:

- anti personnel landmines, and parts or components for anti personnel landmines
- blinding laser weapons
- man-portable air defence systems (MANPADs) to end users who aren’t states
- non-civil nuclear supplies or materials to a country that’s not one of the other recognised nuclear weapons states (United States, Russia, France and China)

##Apply for an export licence

Within the EU you don’t need a licence if your goods are listed under Annex I.

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

$CTA

There's no charge for a licence.

The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.

ECO also looks at the ‘[incorporation factors](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020708/text/20708w01.htm#column_652)’ if the goods will be incorporated into military equipment which will then be exported to another country.

###How ECO decides whether to give licences

Decisions are partly based on where you’re exporting to.

For example, ECO won’t usually give a licence if there’s an embargo on exporting military goods. Embargoed countries are:

- Argentina (if the goods will be used by the Argentine military)
- Armenia and Azerbaijan (if the goods could be used on the border between the two countries, or in the Nagorno-Karabakh region)
- Belarus
- Democratic Republic of Congo
- Eritrea
- Iran
- Ivory Coast
- Lebanon
- Libya
- North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)
- Republic of Guinea
- Russia
- Sierra Leone
- Somalia
- South Sudan
- Sudan
- Syria
- Zimbabwe

[Question for SME: I’ve left Burma and Iraq out of this list because the current GOV.UK guidance seems to suggest either than the embargo is suspended or that licences may be granted for exports to the Iraqui government or multinational forces. Is that right?]

[Question for SME: are the items listed in the relevant EU regulations on Iran (eg the provisions of Council Regulation (EU) 267/2012 related to missile technology) already covered on the consolidated military list?]

There are some limited exceptions (eg for some types of goods that will be used for humanitarian relief or peacekeeping).

[Question for SME: how would we describe the limited exception that exists for Sierra Leone?]

ECO won’t usually give a licence to export small arms, light weapons, weapon components or ammunition to:

- Benin
- Burkina Faso
- Cape Verde
- The Gambia
- Ghana
- Guinea Bissau
- Liberia
- Mali
- Niger
- Nigeria
- Senegal
- Togo

##Taking military goods out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take military goods out of the country temporarily (eg to demonstrate them to potential buyers at a trade show or take them to a commemorative military event).

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

##Sharing classified information

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means:

- information or equipment classified as [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- information or equipment classified as ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

It’s not just exporters and potential exporters who must apply approval. The rule applies to anyone sharing classified information (for example, academics and researchers).

[Question for SME: does it apply to anyone - eg journalists?]

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.

## Trafficking, brokering and arranging sales or movements

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the consolidated military list.

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one country to another. For example:

- arranging or negotiating sales
- providing freight or insurance
- providing financial or legal advice
- arranging intra company transfers
- drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

## When you have your licence

You are responsible for making sure that your licence is still valid when you export the goods.

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your licence when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/).

ECO carries out regular compliance visits to licence holders.

The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

- what records to keep
- what compliance processes to put in place
- how to train staff
- how compliance audits work

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could face a fine or prison sentence.
