The UK strategic export control lists include finished items or systems, raw materials and components. For example:

* weapons and explosives
* goods, technology or services or components designed or modified for military use (for example vehicles, aircraft or marine craft, imaging equipment, armoured protective equipment, cryptographic technology or training materials for a weapons system)
* ‘dual use’ items - goods, technology, documents or diagrams which meet certain technical standards and could be used for military or civilian purposes (for example nuclear materials, chemical agents, electronics, computer or telecommunications equipment, sensors, lasers, machine tools, navigation and avionics equipment, marine technology or aerospace technology)

The the UK strategic export control lists also cover the transfer of information that could be used for military or dual use purposes. For example:

* technical or training manuals
* diagrams or blueprints

This includes information in any form. For example print, email, telephone or electronic file transfer.

## When you need an export licence

If you don’t get a licence for items that need one your goods will be delayed at customs. They could be confiscated and you could be fined or prosecuted.

Use the [goods checker](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to find out if your goods are on the UK strategic export control lists, and how they’re categorised.

Or [download a copy of the UK strategic export control lists](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items-that-require-export-authorisation).

You must have a licence to supply anything on the UK strategic export control lists to someone based outside the UK, unless:

* you're exporting dual use items to some EU countries or the Channel Islands
* you're exporting goods owned by the Ministry of Defence

### Exporting dual use items to EU countries

If your items are categorised as ‘Schedule 3 UK controlled dual-use, software and technology’, you may not need a licence if the goods are going to another EU country.

The European Commission publishes information on which EU countries require licences for dual use items in its [‘national measures’ information note](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/import-and-export-rules/export-from-eu/dual-use-controls/index_en.htm).

You don't need a licence to export dual use items to the Channel Islands.

Even if your items don’t need a licence, the customs and transport documents must state that the items can only be moved outside the EU with an export licence.

### Exporting goods owned by the Ministry of Defence

You don't need a licence to export goods owned by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).

Instead, get an approval letter from the Arms Control and Counter Proliferation Policy (ACP) office in the MOD. Email <acp-elc@mod.uk> or call 020 7218 9080 for details.

## Goods that don’t usually need a licence

Even if your items wouldn’t usually need a licence, you must must not export, traffic or broker the movement of any items if you find out they might be used:

* for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) purposes (for example, chemicals, biological agents or technology that might be used in a nuclear weapons facility)
* for military purposes in an an [embargoed country](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#how-eco-decides-whether-to-give-licences)

These are called ‘end use’, ‘end user’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to request end user advice from the Export Control Organisation (ECO).

You must apply for a licence if ECO tells you to.

## Apply for an export licence

Depending on the type of goods and the destination, you may be able to apply to use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL). It’s usually much quicker to use an OGEL.

[Use the OGEL checker](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/) to see if you can use an OGEL.

If you can’t use an OGEL, you’ll need to apply for one of the other types of export licence.

There's no charge for a licence.

The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

## Taking military or dual use goods out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take military or dual use goods out of the country temporarily (eg to demonstrate them to potential buyers at a trade show or take them to a commemorative military event).

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

## How ECO decides whether to give licences

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.

ECO also looks at the ‘[incorporation factors](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020708/text/20708w01.htm#column_652)’ if the goods will be incorporated into military equipment which will then be exported to another country.

There’s a complete ban on exporting:

* anti personnel landmines, and parts or components for anti personnel landmines
* blinding laser weapons
* man-portable air defence systems (MANPADs) to end users who aren’t states
* non-civil nuclear supplies or materials to a country that’s not one of the other recognised nuclear weapons states (United States, Russia, France and China)

For other items, decisions are partly based on where you’re exporting to.

For example, ECO won’t usually give a licence if there’s an embargo on exporting military goods (arms embargo). Embargoed countries are:

* Argentina (if the goods will be used by the Argentine military)
* Armenia and Azerbaijan (if the goods could be used on the border between the two countries, or in the Nagorno-Karabakh region)
* Belarus
* Democratic Republic of Congo
* Eritrea
* Iran
* Ivory Coast
* Lebanon
* Libya
* North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea)
* Republic of Guinea
* Russia
* Sierra Leone
* Somalia
* South Sudan
* Sudan
* Syria
* Zimbabwe

There's also an embargo on exporting jet fuel and jet fuel additives to Syria.

There are some limited exceptions (eg for some types of goods that will be used for humanitarian relief or peacekeeping).

There's an embargo on exporting small arms, light weapons, weapon components or ammunition to:

* Benin
* Burkina Faso
* Cape Verde
* The Gambia
* Ghana
* Guinea Bissau
* Liberia
* Mali
* Niger
* Nigeria
* Senegal
* Togo

There's an embargo on exporting any of the following to China:

* lethal weapons such as machine guns, large calibre weapons, bombs, torpedoes, rockets and missiles (plus specially designed components and ammunition for these items)
* military aircraft and helicopters, vessels of war, armoured fighting vehicles and other weapons platforms
* any equipment which might be used for internal repression

## Trafficking, brokering and arranging sales or movements

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating sales
* providing freight or insurance services
* providing financial or legal advice
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the UK strategic export control lists. 

There’s one exception to this. You don’t always need a licence to broker the transfer of items categorised as ‘Schedule 3 UK controlled dual-use, software and technology’ within the EU. 

The European Commission publishes information on which EU countries require licences for dual use items in its [‘national measures’ information note](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/import-and-export-rules/export-from-eu/dual-use-controls/index_en.htm).

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

## Sharing classified information

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means:

* information or equipment classified as [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
* information or equipment classified as ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

It’s not just exporters and potential exporters who must apply approval. The rule applies to anyone sharing classified information (for example, academics and researchers).

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.

## Your licence responsibilities

You must include a copy of the licence with the shipping paperwork. If you’re posting the goods, you must include a copy of the licence in a separate envelope, attached to the package.

You are responsible for making sure that your export licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/).

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could be fined or prosecuted.

### If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) 

If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL), [check the terms of your OGEL](link to collection of OGEL documents).

### If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)

* [contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) in advance to arrange an inspection of your goods (goods must be available for inspection at least 3 days before the export date)
* keep records of end user details

### ECO compliance visits

ECO carries out regular compliance visits to make sure licence holders follow the correct processes. The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:
