##Veterinary medicines
{:Veterinary-medicines}

You can import veterinary medicines if there isn’t a suitable one in the UK under the [rules for unauthorised medicines ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-cascade-prescribing-unauthorised-medicines) (‘the Cascade’.

You need to apply for an import certificate from Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). How you do this depends on whether you’re:

- a veterinary surgeon
- a wholesaler supplying veterinary surgeons

##If you’re a veterinary surgeon

To apply for a certificate you need:

- to know if the medicine is EU-authorised - check using the Product Information Database](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/)
- your RCVS number - you can [search the register](http://www.rcvs.org.uk/find-a-surgeon/surgeon)
- access to a printer to print your certificate [not strictly true that you need this to apply]

If the medicine isn’t fully authorised in the country you’re importing from, [contact VMD] before you apply. You can check the database medicines of authorised in other EU countries http://vet.eudrapharm.eu/vet/azResultsPage.do

I understand the certificate will be valid for no more than one year and the total amount requested does not exceed more than one year supply. 

[Apply online to get a certificate](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/default.aspx) for:

- an EU-authorised veterinary medicine - you’ll get a Special Imports Certificate (SIC)
- any other medicine  - you’ll get a Special Treatment Certificate (STC)

For STCs, you’ll need to apply separately for each species of animal that the medicine is for.

If the online system is down, you can use [paper forms].
{‘Other’ meds consists of human meds, or veterinary meds from outside the EU. Do we need to say this?)

The certificate is free. 

After you’ve applied, you’ll get an email. It’ll either:

- include your certificate
- say that VMD need to evaluate your application - if successful, you’ll get your certificate within 10 working days

If you need the medicine urgently, VMD may be able to issue your certificate within 2 working days. Contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> to request this, explaining why your case is urgent. 

[Do you need a manufacturer’s licence to import human medicines if they will be used for animals?]

###Medicines that haven’t been imported into the UK before 

When applying online, you may find that the medicine you’re importing hasn’t been imported into the UK before.

You apply the same way for a certificate, but you’ll also need copies of:

- summary of product characteristics (SPC), or equivalent information for medicines outside the EU, in English
- the product label, in the language of the country you’re importing from

Your application will take longer, but your certificate should be emailed to you within 15 working days.

[SME question: if you're importing a new product as a wholesaler, what do you do?]

###After you apply

Keep records of use - VMD can ask to see them [, eg to check you’re following the rules of the Cascade]

You’ll need to follow the rules for cascading  [this is included in the declaration part of the service]

###If you import from outside the EU

You can’t usually keep medicines in stock. Contact the VMD if you need to do this.

If you have medicine remaining when your certificate expires (1 year after it was issued), you must re-apply for a certificate to cover the amount you have in stock.

###If the online system is down

You can use paper forms if the online system isn’t working. Use either the form for:

- EU-authorised medicines (STC)
- other medicines (SIC)

###Import veterinary medicines for research

You need a free Research Import Certificate (RIC) to import a medicine or substance to treat an animal as part of an experimental trial.

You’ll need the following details from your [Home Office project licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals#applying-for-licences):

- the licence number 
- the Place of Certificate Designation (PCD) number

You can then [apply for a RIC](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ric/Application.aspx) online.

###If you need to import more than one medicine

You can only apply to import one medicine (or substance, or combination of active substances) at a time.

Once your original RIC application has been approved or rejected, you can apply to import another medicine.

You have to apply for each product, active substance or fixed combination of active substances separately. 

[Question for fact check: how long does it take to get a RIC?]

###Urgent applications

An application is treated as urgent if it is for a product for which the VMD thinks there is an immediate, clinically threatening need.

If you think your individual application is urgent, provide an explanation of the urgency.

You can also email [importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk) for help.

##If you need help

Email: importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk

an EU authorised veterinary medicine
an EU authorised Human medicine or a medicinal product from outside the EU

###If you’re a wholesaler/
{:wholesale-certificate}

You need a WDIC certificate to import medicines to supply to vets.

[question for fact check: the source content say that registered pharmacists can also apply for WDIC and that they’ll need their registration number. How they can apply when the online service requires the user to select a wholesaler? Do they still have to use the paper form?]

[Question for fact check - if a wholesaler wants to supply a retailer rather than a vets, is it correct they need a manufacturer licence instead of a WDIC certificate if they’re importing from outside the EEA?
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-authorisations-for-veterinary-medicines]
If that is true, what do they require if they import from within the EU to supply a retailer. It looks like from the live content that they need neither a manufacturer licence nor a WDIC. is that right?

So, you ne

You can now apply online!
https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/wdic-application.aspx

You’ll need your WDA number
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-veterinary-medicine-wholesale-dealers-authorisation-wda

I understand the certificate will be valid for no more than one year and the total amount requested does not exceed more than one year supply. To legally continue holding imported product after the certificate has expired, I will need to obtain a new import certificate.

You need to:

- make sure you’ve got a [wholesaler licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences#veterinary-licences)
- make sure the vet you’re supplying has a STC or SIC certificate
- complete the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549415/_630639_Application_Form_WDIC.docx) (MS Word Document, 42.6KB) - you can’t apply online
- email it to [importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk)

Check the rules If you’re importing a [controlled drug](link to anchor up page).

You should get your certificate emailed to you within 10 working days, if your application is successful.

The certificate is free for smaller wholesalers. 





Otherwise, it costs £760 if there are more than 100 SICs or STCs that name the you as the importer in the 12 months before your application. You’ll get an invoice after you’ve received your certificate.

##Importing allergens to supply a vet

You usually need a [manufacturing authorisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-certificate-to-import-a-veterinary-medicine-into-the-uk) to package and label unauthorised veterinary medicines.

But a vet or a pharmacist without this authorisation can relabel or repackage instead, as long as the allergen is a finished product (not one that needs preparation or mixing before you supply it).

###What you need to 

Follow the usual rules for importing as a wholesaler. When applying for the SIC or STC, the vet should name your laboratory as importer.

Extemporaneous preparations, that is, medicines that are tailor-made for a particular animal by a veterinary surgeon, a pharmacist or a person who holds an appropriate manufacturing authorisation
