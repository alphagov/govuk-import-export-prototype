You can import veterinary medicines if there isn’t a suitable one in the UK under the rules of [the Cascade](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-cascade-prescribing-unauthorised-medicines).

You need to apply for an import certificate from Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). How you do this depends on whether you’re a:

- [veterinary surgeon](#vet)
- [researcher](#research)
- [wholesaler](#wholesale)

[Question for fact check: do the rules for controlled drugs apply to all, not just WDICs as implied by the live content?]

##If you’re a veterinary surgeon
{:#vet}

To apply for a free certificate you'll need:

- to know if the medicine is EU-authorised - check using the [EU veterinary medicinal product](http://vet.eudrapharm.eu/vet/searchbykeyword.do)
- your RCVS number - you can [search the register](http://www.rcvs.org.uk/find-a-surgeon/surgeon)

$CTA

[Apply online to get a certificate](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/default.aspx).

$CTA

You'll get a Special Imports Certificate (SIC) if you're importing EU-authorised medicine. Otherwise you'll get a Special Treatment Certificate (STC). For STCs, you’ll need to apply separately for each species of animal that the medicine is for.

If the medicine isn’t fully authorised in the country you’re importing from, contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> before you apply. 

If the online system is down, you can use [paper forms](#paper-forms).

###How long it takes
You’ll get an email after you've applied. It’ll either:

- include your certificate
- say that VMD need to evaluate your application - you’ll get your certificate within 10 working days, if you're successful

If you need the medicine urgently, VMD may be able to issue your certificate within 2 working days. Contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> and explain why your case is urgent. 

When applying, you may find that the medicine you’re importing hasn’t been imported into the UK before. If so, you should get your certificate within 15 working days.

###How much you can import

If you have medicine remaining when your certificate expires (1 year after it was issued), you must re-apply for a certificate to cover the amount you have in stock.

Medicines from outside the EU can't usually be kept in stock. Contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> if you need to do this.


###If the online system is down
{:#paper-forms}

You can use paper forms if the online system isn’t working. Use either the form for [STC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549418/_630643_Application_Form_SIC.docx) (44KB) or [SIC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549417/_630628_Application_Form_STC.docx) (62KB). Both forms are in Word format.

##If you're a researcher
{:#research}

You need a free Research Import Certificate (RIC) to import a medicine or substance to treat an animal as part of an experimental trial.

To apply for the certificate, you’ll need the following details from your [Home Office project licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals#applying-for-licences):

- the licence number 
- the Place of Certificate Designation (PCD) number

$CTA

$CTA

You can only apply to import one medicine at a time.

###How long it takes

[Question for fact check: how long does it take to get a RIC? Are there any limits over how much you can order or keep in stock, as with SICs and STC]


##If you’re a wholesaler
{:#wholesale}

You need a Wholesale Dealers Import Certificate (WDIC) to import medicines to supply to vets.

[question for fact check: should we link to [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-authorisations-for-veterinary-medicines#gmp-requirements-for-active-substances-as-starting-materials](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-authorisations-for-veterinary-medicines#gmp-requirements-for-active-substances-as-starting-materials) for businesses that supply retailers with imports from outside the EEA]

[question for fact check: is it correct that an importer who supplies a retailer with veterinary medicines from the EU requires neither an import certificate nor a WDIC?]

To apply, you'll need:

- the number from your [wholesale dealer's authorisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-veterinary-medicine-wholesale-dealers-authorisation-wda) (WDA)
- to make sure the vet you’re supplying has an import certificate

$CTA
 
[Apply for a WDIC](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/wdic-application.aspx).

$CTA

[question: the source content say that registered pharmacists can also apply for WDIC (and that they'll need their registration no. How they can apply when the online service requires the user to select a wholesaler? Do they still have to use the paper form?]

I understand the certificate will be valid for no more than one year and the total amount requested does not exceed more than one year supply. To legally continue holding imported product after the certificate has expired, I will need to obtain a new import certificate.

###Other ways to apply
 
You can also apply using the [paper form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549415/_630639_Application_Form_WDIC.docx) (MS Word Document, 42.6KB).

[Question for fact check: Is this paper form still in use? See also above comment re registered pharmacists who can't use the online service by the looks of it].

###How long it takes

You should get your certificate emailed to you within 10 working days, if your application is successful.

[Question for fact check: is this timescale stil accurate with the new online system?]

###Fees

The certificate is free for smaller wholesalers. 

Otherwise, it costs £760 if you're named as the importer on more than 100 import certificates over a 12 month period. You’ll get an invoice after you’ve received your certificate.

###Importing allergens to supply a vet

A vet or a pharmacist without a [manufacturing authorisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-certificate-to-import-a-veterinary-medicine-into-the-uk) can relabel or repackage allergens that are imported as a finished product. 

This dispensation doesn't apply to allergens that need preparation or mixing before its' supplied.
