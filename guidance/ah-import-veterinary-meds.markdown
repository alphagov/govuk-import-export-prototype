You can import veterinary medicines if there isn’t a suitable one in the UK under the rules of [the Cascade](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-cascade-prescribing-unauthorised-medicines).

You need to apply for an import certificate from Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD). How you do this depends on whether you’re a:

- [veterinary surgeon](#vet)
- [researcher](#research)
- [wholesaler](#wholesale)


##If you’re a veterinary surgeon
{:#vet}

To apply for a free certificate you'll need:

- to know if the medicine is EU-authorised - check using the [EU veterinary medicinal product](http://vet.eudrapharm.eu/vet/searchbykeyword.do)
- your RCVS number - you can [search the register](http://www.rcvs.org.uk/find-a-surgeon/surgeon)

###Apply online

The certificate you need depends on whether you're importing:

- an EU-authorised veterinary medicine - [apply for Special Imports Certificate](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/sic-application.aspx) (SIC)
- any other medicine  - [apply for Special Treatment Certificate](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/stc-application.aspx) (STC)

For STCs, you’ll need to apply separately for each species of animal that the medicine is for.

If the medicine isn’t fully authorised in the country you’re importing from, contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> before you apply. 

If the online system is down, you can use [paper forms](#paper-forms).

###How long it takes
You’ll get an email after you've applied. It’ll either:

- include your certificate
- say that VMD need to evaluate your application - you’ll get your certificate within 10 working days, if you're successful

If you need the medicine urgently, VMD may be able to issue your certificate within 2 working days. Contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> and explain why your case is urgent. 

When applying, you may find that the medicine you’re importing hasn’t been imported into the UK before. If so, you should get your certificate within 15 working days.

###How much you can import

If you have medicine remaining when your certificate expires (1 year after it was issued), you must re-apply for a certificate to cover the amount you have in stock.

Medicines from outside the EU can't usually be kept in stock. Contact <importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk> if you need to do this.


###If the online system is down
{:#paper-forms}

You can use paper forms if the online system isn’t working. Use either the form for [STC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549418/_630643_Application_Form_SIC.docx) (44KB) or [SIC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549417/_630628_Application_Form_STC.docx) (62KB). Both forms are in Word format.

##Import veterinary medicines for research
{:#research}

You need a free Research Import Certificate (RIC) to import a medicine or substance to treat an animal as part of an experimental trial.

You’ll need the following details from your [Home Office project licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/research-and-testing-using-animals#applying-for-licences):

- the licence number 
- the Place of Certificate Designation (PCD) number

You can then [apply for a RIC](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ric/Application.aspx) online.

###If you need to import more than one medicine

You can only apply to import one medicine (or substance, or combination of active substances) at a time.

Once your original RIC application has been approved or rejected, you can apply to import another medicine.

You have to apply for each product, active substance or fixed combination of active substances separately. 

[Question for fact check: how long does it take to get a RIC?]


##If you’re a wholesaler
{:#wholesale}

You need a WDIC certificate to import medicines to supply to vets.

[question for fact check: should we link to [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-authorisations-for-veterinary-medicines#gmp-requirements-for-active-substances-as-starting-materials](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/manufacturing-authorisations-for-veterinary-medicines#gmp-requirements-for-active-substances-as-starting-materials) for businesses that supply retailers with imports from outside the EEA]

[question for fact check: is it correct that an importer who supplies a retailer with veterinary medicines from the EU requires neither an import certificate nor a WDIC?]

You can [apply online for a WDIC](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/wdic-application.aspx).

You’ll need your [wholesale dealer's authorisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-veterinary-medicine-wholesale-dealers-authorisation-wda) (WDA) number.

[question: the source content say that registered pharmacists can also apply for WDIC (and that they'll need their registration no. How they can apply when the online service requires the user to select a wholesaler? Do they still have to use the paper form?]

I understand the certificate will be valid for no more than one year and the total amount requested does not exceed more than one year supply. To legally continue holding imported product after the certificate has expired, I will need to obtain a new import certificate.

You need to:

- make sure you’ve got a [wholesaler licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences#veterinary-licences)
- make sure the vet you’re supplying has a STC or SIC certificate
- complete the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549415/_630639_Application_Form_WDIC.docx) (MS Word Document, 42.6KB) - you can’t apply online

Check the rules if you’re importing a [controlled drug] (anchor link on process for human meds?)

You should get your certificate emailed to you within 10 working days, if your application is successful.

The certificate is free for smaller wholesalers. 

Otherwise, it costs £760 if you're named as the importer on more than 100 import certificates over a 12 month period. You’ll get an invoice after you’ve received your certificate.

###Importing allergens to supply a vet

You usually need a [manufacturing authorisation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-certificate-to-import-a-veterinary-medicine-into-the-uk) to package and label unauthorised veterinary medicines.

But a vet or a pharmacist without this authorisation can relabel or repackage allergens that are imported as a finished product. This dispensation doesn't apply to allergens that need preparation or mixing before its' supplied.
