##Check you have a licence

To export most veterinary medicines you must have one of the following:

- a drug manufacturer licence (sometimes called ‘ManA’)
- a wholesale dealer licence (‘WDA’)
- a marketing licence (‘MA’)

[Apply for a licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences#veterinary-licences) if you don’t have one.

You don’t need one of these licences for ‘over the counter’ medicines classed as AVM-GSL. You can check classifications on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) [product information database](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/Search.aspx).


##Export certificates

Talk to the importer who’s receiving your goods to find out which type of export certificate you need. 

[Question for SME: Will the importer know this? If not, how can someone find out which certificate they need? And are there countries that don’t require a certificate, eg within the EU?]

###Defra-2

Defra-2 shows that the product is authorised for sale and supply in the UK.

###Defra-1 and Defra-3

Defra-1 and Defra-3 show:

- the product is manufactured in the UK
- the product meets good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements
- the UK administrative address
- the UK manufacturing site addresses
- the authorised operations at the UK manufacturing sites

###Defra-4

Defra-4 shows both:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that active substances in your product are available in a UK-authorised product

###Defra-SFA

Defra-SFA shows either:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that the Specified Feed Additive (SFA) in your product is a UK-authorised product

###If you need extra information on the certificate

Some countries need information that are not on the standard certificates.

You can ask for this information to be included for Defra-1, 2, or 4 certificates, but you must also include some [standard wording](#wording) in your application.


##Apply for a certificate

You have to [apply by email for a Defra-SFA certificate].

Otherwise, you register to apply online by emailing exportcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk.

You can then sign in to apply:
https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/EC/Login.aspx

The fee is £30 (£15 for a certified copy). You’ll get an invoice after you’ve applied from The VMD (Veterinary Medicines Directorate)

As part of your application, you can ask for the following to be attached to your export documentation:

- manufacturing authorisation
- a summary of product characteristics (SPC) or product literature (or both)
- a marketing authorisation certificate
- Spanish or French versions of your documents

###Other ways to apply

[Question for SME: With the exception of Defra-SFA, why would someone apply by email? Do many people use this route?]

You can also apply by emailing <exportcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk>.

Include:

- a covering letter on headed paper
- your email address for the invoice
- if you’re not the manufacturer, a letter from them giving permission for their details to be used in your application (Defra-1, 3 or 4 only)
- a completed ‘schedule’ template (not required for Defra-3)

A schedule give specific information about your export. Download and fill in one of the following:

- [Defra-1] schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421321/758549_Defra1_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 19KB)
- [Defra-2 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421323/761073_Defra2_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.5KB)
- [Defra-4 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421325/765798_Defra4_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.3KB)
- [Defra-SFA schedule template])https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421326/766188_DefraSFA_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 16.5KB)

In the schedule, you can include that the product is ‘free from ingredients of a ruminant origin’ (if requested by the importing country). You must make it clear that the statement is made by you and not the VMD.
