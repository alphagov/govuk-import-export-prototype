You must have a licence and certificate to export veterinary medicines outside the UK. This includes moving them within the EU.

##Check you have a licence

To export most veterinary medicines you must have one of the following:

- a drug manufacturer licence (sometimes called ‘ManA’)
- a wholesale dealer licence (‘WDA’)
- a marketing licence (‘MA’)

[Apply for a licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences#veterinary-licences) if you don’t have one.

You don’t need one of these licences for ‘over the counter’ medicines classed as 'AVM-GSL'. You can check classifications on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) [product information database](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/Search.aspx).


##Work out which export certificate you need

There are 5 types of certificate. 

Which one you need will depend on what you need to prove to the country you're exporting to. Talk to the importer who’s receiving your goods to find out.

[Question for SME: Are there countries that don’t require a certificate, eg within the EU?]

###Defra-2

The Defra-2 certificate shows that the product is authorised for sale and supply in the UK.

###Defra-1 and Defra-3

Both Defra-1 and Defra-3 show:

- the product is manufactured in the UK
- the product meets good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements
- the UK administrative address
- the UK manufacturing site addresses
- the authorised operations at the UK manufacturing sites

###Defra-4

Defra-4 shows both:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that active substances in your product are available in a UK-authorised product

###Defra-SFA

Defra-SFA shows either:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that the Specified Feed Additive (SFA) in your product is a UK-authorised product

###If you need extra information on the certificate
{:#extra-information}

Some countries need information that are not on the standard certificates.

You can ask for this information to be included for Defra-1, 2, or 4 certificates, but you must also include some [standard wording](#wording) in your application.


##Apply for a certificate

You have to [apply by email for Defra-SFA](#apply-email).

Otherwise, register to apply online by emailing <exportcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk>.

You can then [sign in to apply for a certificate](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/EC/Login.aspx). You should get your certificate within 10 days.

The fee is £30 (plus £15 for each certified copy, if you need these). You’ll get an invoice after you’ve applied.

When applying, you can ask for the following to be attached to your export documentation:

- manufacturing authorisation
- a summary of product characteristics (SPC) or product literature (or both)
- a marketing authorisation certificate
- Spanish or French versions of your documents
 
[Question for SME: What does someone do with the certificate when they've got it? Attach it to their consignment?]

###Other ways to apply
{:#apply-email}

[Question for SME: With the exception of Defra-SFA, why would someone apply by email? Do many people use this route?]

You can apply by emailing <exportcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk>.

Include:

- a covering letter on headed paper
- an email address for the invoice to be sent to
- if you’re not the manufacturer, a letter from them giving permission for their details to be used in your application (Defra-1, 3 or 4 only)
- a completed ‘schedule’ template (not required for Defra-3)

A schedule gives specific information about your export. Download and fill in one of the following:

- [Defra-1 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421321/758549_Defra1_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 19KB)
- [Defra-2 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421323/761073_Defra2_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.5KB)
- [Defra-4 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421325/765798_Defra4_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.3KB)
- [Defra-SFA schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421326/766188_DefraSFA_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 16.5KB)

In the schedule, you can include that the product is ‘free from ingredients of a ruminant origin’ (if requested by the importing country). You must make it clear that the statement is made by you and not the VMD.

###Standard wording
{:#wording}

If you need [extra information](#extra-information) on the certificate, you must also include the appropriate standard wording.

Defra-1 and 4 wording:

> The VMD stamp and signature on this page confirm the site is GMP compliant and holds a Manufacturing Authorisation. It does not independently verify any of the other information contained on this page. The Qualified Person at the site named on page one is responsible for the veracity and validity of the other information on this document.

Defra-2 wording:

> The VMD stamp and signature on this page confirm the veterinary medicines named on
page two hold a Marketing Authorisation in the same name. It does not independently verify any of the other information contained on this page.
