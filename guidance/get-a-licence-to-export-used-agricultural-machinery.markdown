Your used agricultural machinery needs to travel with a plant health certificate when you outside the EU.

You don’t need to do any inside the EU.

##Exporting plants from England or Wales

Most countries require you to have a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) if you export used farm machinery.

###Applying for a plant health certificate in England and Wales 

You must apply for your machinery to be inspected by [filling in this form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536164/form-hh36a.pdf).

###Fees  

It usually costs £13.87 for the plant health certificate and £65.24 for each 15 minutes of a site inspection.

The minimum cost of any inspection followed by tests is £130.48

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5,000 in the last financial year
