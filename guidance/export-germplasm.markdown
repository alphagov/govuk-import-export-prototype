You need a certificate to export animal semen, ova, embryos and other germplasm used for breeding.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

There are different rules if you're exporting germplasm:

- that won't be used for breeding - follow the rules for exporting [animal by-products](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-furs-skins-and-other-animal-products.html)
- from [endangered animals](#germplasm-from-endangered-animals)

[Question for SME: When is germplasm not used for breeding and does it count in the types of things that need a commercial document? If not, we'll change this]

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

To move germplasm within the EU, you must:

* apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health certificate (ITAHC)
* register your premises

###Apply for an ITAHC

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) if you’ve not used it before.
s3. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the germplasm you’re exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) or [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.
s5. Your certificate will be sent to your official veterinarian once your germplasm have passed inspection. If your official veterinarian doesn’t receive the certificate, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)
s6. Include the certificate when you export your consignment.

Instead of using TRACES, you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your species of animal, [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) (or [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

###Register your premises

You also need to register your premises to export within the EU - this is the place you keep the semen, ova or embryos in the UK.

[Contact the Centre for International Trade](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to arrange this.

[Question for SME: What are the steps that users must take to get their premises registered?]

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491835/contacts-international-trade.pdf).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk> (or contact [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You’ll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your germplasm meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

[Question for SME: How long do you need to keep your EHC for?]

##Germplasm from endangered animals

Use the Species+ tool to [search for the animal](https://www.speciesplus.net/) that the germplasm came from. Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu-endangered) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu-endangered).

If Species+ says the animal is banned, you can't export its germplasm. 

###Within the EU
{:#within-eu-endangered}

If the animal is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate.

You don’t need any special documents if you’re using germplasm for non-commercial reasons, eg for scientific research.

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 
Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or post it to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).
  
Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. 

You should get your certificate within 15 working days.

###Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu-endangered}

If it's classed as Annex A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit.

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a CITES export permit. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

If you're re-exporting goods, include a CITES import permit to prove it legally entered the EU.

Email or post the completed form to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

If you're exporting as part of conservation work, you might be able to [get a fee waiver](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/50323/form-citb20.pdf).
