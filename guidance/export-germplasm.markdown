You need permission to export semen, ova, embryos and other germplasm used for breeding.

If you’re exporting germplasm that isn’t used for breeding purposes, [follow the same rules as for animal by-products](link to ABP content).

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

There are different rules if you're [exporting germplasm from endangered animals](#germplasm-from-endangered-animals)

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

To move germplasm within the EU, you must:

* apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health certificate (ITAHC)
* register your premises

###Apply for an ITAHC

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) if you’ve not used it before.
s3. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the live animals you’re exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) or [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.
s5. Your certificate will be sent to your official veterinarian once your animals have passed inspection. If your official veterinarian doesn’t receive the certificate, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle.](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)
s6. Include the certificate when you export your consignment.
Instead of using TRACES, you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).
Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.
If there isn’t an ITAHC for your species of animal, [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) (or [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

###Get your premises approved

You also need to get your premises approved to export within the EU - this is the place you keep the semen, ova or embryos in the UK.

[Contact the Centre for International Trade](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to arrange this.

##Germplasm from endangered animals

Within the EU, check if your germplasm is from endangered species listed in [appendix 1](http://www.speciesplus.net/).

You usually can’t move germplasm from these endangered animals except in special cases (like for research necessary for the species to survive). [Contact APHA](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

Outside the EU, you need to:

- check the [list of banned exports](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php) - some germplasm to certain countries are banned outright
- [apply for a CITES permit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB), if the animal isn’t banned

Send the permit application form by post or email to [APHA](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html#contacts) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland), including the [fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355264/cites-ag-ct-01.pdf) (PDF, 146KB).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application.

You must pay a £63 for an export licence and £37 for a re-export licence.
