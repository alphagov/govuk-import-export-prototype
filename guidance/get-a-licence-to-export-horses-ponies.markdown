What you need to do to export horses or ponies depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-EU)



$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html)

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

To move horses or ponies within the [EU](/eu-eea) you must:

- [apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate](#animal-health-certificate) (ITAHC)
- [check if you need an animal welfare declaration](#animal-welfare-declaration)

###Apply for an ITAHC
{:#animal-health-certificate}

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your horses. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection. You must keep it for 3 years.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of horse, [contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

[Question for fact check - are there any types of horse that _don’t_ have an ITAHC? If not, can we delete the line above?]


##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

To export horses or ponies outside the EU you must:

- [apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)](#export-health-certificate)
- [check if you need an animal welfare declaration](#animal-welfare-declaration)


###Apply for an EHC
{:#export-health-certificate}

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you're exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet, or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to you within xxx days/weeks.
s4. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). 
s5. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

[Questions for fact check: How long does it usually take to get a EHC? Is there a fee?]

##Check if you need an export welfare declaration
{:#export-welfare-declaration}

Whether you need an [export welfare declaration](#export-welfare-declaration) depends on the horses and where you’re exporting them to.

You don’t need an export declaration if you’re moving:

- horses by direct flight to countries outside of Europe
- horses over 147cm to the Republic of Ireland
- horses or ponies to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man
- [certain horses to France](#france)

Thoroughbred horses don’t need an export declaration if a steward or secretary of [the Jockey Club](http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/contact/contact) certifies that any of the following apply:

- they arrived in Great Britain no more than 1 month before the date of shipment to compete in a race
- they’re being shipped for a race or for training
- they’re being shipped to be used for breeding

###Get an export welfare declaration

If you need an export declaration, download the form for:

- [horses taller than 147cm (14.2 hands)] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413965/exh6.pdf) (PDF, 99.8KB)
- horses or ponies 147cm or less](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413969/exh7.pdf) (PDF, 102KB).

Fill it in and give it to the aircraft or master of the vessel that’s carrying the horses or ponies.


###Export horses to France
{:#france}

You don’t need an export welfare declaration if you’re exporting:

- thoroughbreds used for racing, breeding, training or that are moving to be sold
- French registered Autre Que Pur Sang (AQPS) horses (a type of non-thoroughbred horse)
competing in Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) sponsored events
- horses registered on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register

But you must make sure that each horse travels with a Commercial Document (DOCOM). You can get the document you need through:

- [Weatherbys](https://www.weatherbys.co.uk/) - for thoroughbreds and horses on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register
- [British Equestrian Federation](http://www.bef.co.uk/Contact.aspx) - for FEI horses
- [British Horseracing Authority](http://www.britishhorseracing.com/bha/about-us/contact-bha/) - for racehorses
