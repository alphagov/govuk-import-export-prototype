##Check if you need an export welfare declaration
{:#export-welfare-declaration}

Whether you need an [export welfare declaration](#export-welfare-declaration) depends on the horses and where you’re exporting them to.

You don’t need an export declaration if you’re moving:

- horses by direct flight to countries outside of Europe
- horses over 147cm to the Republic of Ireland
- horses or ponies to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man
- [certain horses to France](#france)

Thoroughbred horses don’t need an export declaration if a steward or secretary of [the Jockey Club](http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/contact/contact) certifies that any of the following apply:

- they arrived in Great Britain no more than 1 month before the date of shipment to compete in a race
- they’re being shipped for a race or for training
- they’re being shipped to be used for breeding

###Get an export welfare declaration

- [horses or ponies 147cm or less](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413969/exh7.pdf) (PDF, 102KB).

Fill it in and give it to the aircraft or master of the vessel that’s carrying the horses or ponies.

###Export horses to France

- thoroughbreds used for racing, breeding, training or that are moving to be sold
- French registered Autre Que Pur Sang (AQPS) horses (a type of non-thoroughbred horse)
competing in Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) sponsored events
