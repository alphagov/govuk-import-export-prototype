##Get a horse passport

You must [get a horse passport](/horse-passport) for every horse you own.

If you’re exporting horses, their keeper or transporter must have each horse’s passport with them at all times.

%You can be fined up to £5000 if your horse doesn’t have a valid horse passport.%

##Get an export welfare declaration

If you’re exporting horses and ponies within or outside of the EU, you must print and complete an export licence application form, unless you have an exemption from the Secretary of State.

Download an [export licence application form for horses taller than 147cm (14.2 hands)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413965/exh6.pdf) (PDF, 99.8KB).

Download an [export licence application form for ponies or horses that are shorter than 147cm (14.2 hands)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413969/exh7.pdf) (PDF, 102KB).

The pilot of the aircraft or master of the vessel that’s carrying the horses or ponies you're exporting must have a copy of the export welfare declaration.

###When you don’t need an export welfare declaration

You don’t need an export welfare declaration if you’re moving:

- horses or ponies to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man
- horses over 147cm to the Republic of Ireland
- horses by direct flight to countries outside of Europe

Thoroughbred horses don’t need an export declaration if a steward or secretary of [the Jockey Club](http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/contact/contact) certifies that:

- they arrived in Great Britain no more than 1 month before the date of shipment to compete in a race
- they’re being shipped for a race or for training
- they’re being shipped to be used for breeding

###Export horses to France

You don’t need an export welfare declaration if you’re exporting:

- thoroughbreds used for racing, breeding, training or that are moving to be sold
- French registered Autre Que Pur Sang (AQPS) horses (a type of non-thoroughbred horse)
sports horses competing in Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) sponsored events
- horses registered on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register

You must make sure that each horse travels with a Commercial Document (DOCOM).

You can get the DOCOM you need through:

- [Weatherbys](https://www.weatherbys.co.uk/) - for thoroughbreds and horses on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register
- [British Equestrian Federation](http://www.bef.co.uk/Contact.aspx) - for FEI horses
- [British Horseracing Authority](http://www.britishhorseracing.com/bha/about-us/contact-bha/) - for racehorses

##Export horses within the EU

You must have an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move horses and ponies within the EU.

You must keep this document for at least 3 years.

###Using an existing ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must [tell APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487433/form-exa31-livestock.pdf) (PDF, 755KB) and send it to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) - or use [form EXA31 (Poultry)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487438/form-exa31-poultry.pdf) (PDF, 617KB) instead if you're exporting poultry or hatching eggs

###Applying for a new ITAHC

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply for a new ITAHC.

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

##Export horses outside the EU

You must get an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export horses and ponies outside the EU. You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of authorities in the destination country, and any other requirements they may have.

###Get an existing EHC issued

There will usually already be an EHC for the type of horse or pony you’re exporting and where you’re exporting it to.

Check the [List of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB) to see if the EHC you need already exists and is available for issue.

If the certificate you want already exists, and is available for issue, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) and ask them to send you an application form and a copy of the EHC.

You must complete the application form and the EHC as fully as you can and send it back to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).

###Nominate an official veterinarian

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

To find an OV, you can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

In some cases, there won’t be an available EHC that covers the type of consignment you want to send and the destination you’re sending it to.

This could be because:

- the EHC you want is on hold - eg due to a trade ban enforced by the destination country
- there hasn’t been any previous demand for an EHC for the animal you’re exporting to the destination country
- negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing - agreeing new EHCs can take years or stall due to trade barriers

If the EHC you want doesn’t exist, you should talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

You should send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) who will pass the details to Defra for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.

##Exporting horses and ponies through the EU to a non-EU country

If your consignment will travel through the EU on the way to a non EU country, you may need both an [Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC)](##exporting-horses-and ponies-within-the-eu) and an [EHC](###get-an-export-health-certificate-ehc).

You should look at each stage of the journey and make sure your consignment has the right certification for each.
