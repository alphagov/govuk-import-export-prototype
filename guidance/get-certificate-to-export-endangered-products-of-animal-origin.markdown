[Use the tool](http://www.speciesplus.net/) to check if your product of animal origin is listed as an endangered species - if it’s banned outright you can’t export it.

If it’s listed in Annex A you’ll need  'Article 10 certificates' to export it both inside and outside the EU.

The only exceptions are:

* dead Crocodylia species with source code D, with a uniquely marked, closed leg ring
* any animal product like skin, bones or shells that have been processed before 1947 for example carved or tinted horns or bones used in an antique art object 

If it’s in Annex B or C you’ll also have to get a CITES permit to export your animal product outside the EU. If it's in Annex D check if it's also in Appendix III of the CITES list using the tool. You'll only need a permit if it's in both.

You don’t need to apply for one within the EU but some countries may ask you to prove that your goods entered the EU legally.

If you're exporting a musical instrument made from endangered animals (for example piano with keys made from ivory) you may be able to avoid having to apply for a permit. Contact the [Centre for International Trade in Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) if this applies.

[Check with APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-bristol) if you’re exporting elephant ivory, rhino horn, tigers and their parts and derivatives, bear bile, bear paws and gallbladders, and eggs of native British birds. You could be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years if you break the rules.

##Apply for an ‘Article 10 certificate’

Your application must include supporting documents showing the specimen was acquired or imported lawfully. These could be for:


* imported specimens a copy of the original import permit stamped by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) or the number of that permit 
* specimens previously issued with an Article 10 certificate, the original yellow copy of the certificate
* a specimen taken from the wild, a copy of any licences issued to allow it to be removed from the wild

Complete your [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use). 

Make sure you include your good’s markings correctly (for example it’s tags, microchip numbers or ring number). If they're wrong you're more likely to get a transaction specific certificate instead of a species specific one. This means it only be valid for one sale.

### If you don’t have supporting documents

If you don’t have any of the supporting documents, you might still be able to get an Article 10 certificate. 

You’ll need to provide other details of the specimen’s origin, for example:

* details of its parents and the breeder’s name
* parents’ certificate numbers
* a copy of an import certificate confirming the specimens were bred in captivity, or imported or acquired lawfully
