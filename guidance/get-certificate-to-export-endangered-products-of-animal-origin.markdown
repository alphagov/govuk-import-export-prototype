Use the Species+ tool to [search for the animal](https://www.speciesplus.net/) that the product is made from. Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-the-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-the-eu).

If Species+ says the animal is banned, you can't export the product. There aren't any exceptions to this rule.

[Check with APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-bristol) if you’re exporting elephant ivory, rhino horn, tigers and their parts and derivatives, bear bile, bear paws and gallbladders, and eggs of native British birds. You could be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years if you break the rules.

##Within the EU

If the animal is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must [apply for an Article 10 certificate](#apply-for-an-article-10-certificate) unless it your product is an antique, processed before 1947.

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 
Send it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk>

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. Find out how to pay for your application.

You should get your certificate within 6 weeks.

If you lose your certificate, you can ask APHA for a replacement.


##Outside the EU

If the animal is classed as Annex A, you must [apply for an Article 10 certificate](#apply-for-an-article-10-certificate).

If it's classed as B or C, you need a [CITES export permit](#apply-for-a-cites-permit).

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a [CITES export permit]. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

Email or post the completed form to [APHA](Send the permit application form by post or email to APHA (DEARA in Northern Ireland) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland)

Musical instruments made from endangered animals (for example ivory piano keys) may not need a permit.
