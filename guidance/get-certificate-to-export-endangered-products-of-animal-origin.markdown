Use the Species+ tool to [search for the animal](https://www.speciesplus.net/) that the product is made from. Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

If Species+ says the animal is banned, you can't export the product.

[Check with APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-bristol) if you want to export elephant ivory, rhino horn, tigers and their parts and derivatives, bear bile, bear paws and gallbladders, and eggs of native British birds. 

You’ll only be able to export them in special circumstances like for scientific research, museum exhibitions or if they're your heirlooms - you could be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years if you break the rules.

[Question for SME: Are these things banned?]

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

If the animal is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate.

You don’t need any special documents if:

* your goods are antiques made before 1947
* you're giving your goods away
* you’re using or displaying goods for non-commercial reasons, eg for scientific research or in an educational display


###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 
Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or post it to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. 

You should get your certificate within 15 days.

[Question for SME: Where do users apply for a replacement?]

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

If it's classed as A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit.

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a [CITES export permit]. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES export permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

Email or post the completed form to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

If you regularly travel with musical instruments made from endangered animals (for example ivory piano keys) that you intend to bring back to the UK, you may not need a permit. Contact the [Centre for International Trade in Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to check.
