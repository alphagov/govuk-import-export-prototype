There are special rules for exporting Scotch whisky outside of Scotland.

##Single malt whisky 

Single malt Scotch whisky must not be bottled, or re-bottled, outside Scotland.

The bottle must be:

- no more than 2 litres
- glass, or another substance that's 'inert' (not chemically reactive)
- labelled 'retail sale'

##Other Scotch whiskies

You can only export single grain, blended malt, blended grain or blended Scotch whisky outside Scotland to an ‘[approved bulk importer.](https://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/sdvlookup/showAllBulkImporter.action)’ This is someone outside Scotland who blends, bottles or labels Scotch whisky to sell on.

You must not export these whiskies in a wooden cask or holder.

The bottle must be:

- labelled 'retail sale'
- glass, or another substance that's 'inert' (not chemically reactive)

###Apply to blend, bottle or label Scotch outside Scotland

You need to:

* [register as a bulk importer](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/spiritdrinksapplication/sdvbulkimporter.htm)
* [sign up for the ‘undertaking cover’](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/spiritdrinksapplication/sdvundertaking.htm) to export your goods outside Scotland

You'll need to pay a fee of £xxx. 


[Question for SME: How much is the fee? How long does it take to register and to get undertaking cover?]
