You can’t move single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky, blended grain Scotch whisky or blended Scotch whisky outside Scotland unless it’s:

* in bulk
* being sent someone who’s [met all the requirements](https://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/sdvlookup/showAllBulkImporter.action)

You can move single malt whisky in smaller quantities.

You may need to [check if you meet the criteria](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/236297/scotch-whisky-technical-file-130829.pdf) for Scotch whisky first.

[Question for SME: What quantity qualifies as ‘bulk’?]

##Moving whisky around the UK

If you’re outside Scotland and want to receive Scotch whisky in bulk, you’ll need to apply for the verification scheme.

[Do they only need to apply if they plan to sell them to be blended, bottled or labelled?]

###Applying 

You’ll need to:

* [register as a bulk importer](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/spiritdrinksapplication/sdvbulkimporter.htm)
* [sign up for the ‘undertaking cover’](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/spiritdrinksapplication/sdvundertaking.htm)to move your goods outside the UK  

###Pay a fee

You’ll get an invoice covering the fee for your registration and verification. You should pay the amount you owe within 30 days of the date on the invoice.

[Question for SME: Could we indicate how much this will be or how it’s calculated?]

##Moving whisky outside the UK

You can’t move any Scotch whisky unless it’s in a bottle made from inert material with a label for ‘retail sale’.

You can’t move the following products in a wooden cask or holder:

*single grain Scotch whisky  
*blended malt Scotch whisky  
*blended grain Scotch whisky  
*blended Scotch whisky  

##Single malt Scotch whisky

If you move single malt Scotch whisky your bottle must also be a maximum of 2 litres.

 Single Malt Scotch Whisky may not be bottled, or re-bottled, outside Scotland.
