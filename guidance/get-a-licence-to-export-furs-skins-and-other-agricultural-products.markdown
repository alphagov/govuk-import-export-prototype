You need a certificate or commerical document to export animal by-products, for example:

* skins, wool, leathers and furs    
* bones, carsasses and blood    
* collagen or any animal part used to manufacture drugs   

You'll also need a special certificate to export animal germplasm like semen, ova, embryos from cattle, sheep, goats and pigs 

^The rules are different if they're from other animals [link to endangered animal content].

[Question for SME: Does sheep and goat semen, ova, embryos follow the Balai rules? There seems to be some contradiction]

###Fill in a corporate document to move animal by-products within the EU

This is a signed list including:

* a detailed description of the contents, including category and quantity
* the date of transport
* an address of origin and destination, and contact names at both
* approval or registration numbers for the factory or vehicle
* ear numbers and details of species, where carcasses have been taken from farms

You should keep a copy of the commercial document for at least 2 years.

[Question for SME: Is this just a community transit declaration, if so we can link to the guide]

##Moving germplasm within the EU 

You’ll need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC).

You must keep this document for at least 3 years and it'll only be valid for only one species or one type of product at a time.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Applying for an ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

###Applying for a new ITAHC

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply.


###Nominate a vet
You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> or phone or write to the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester))


Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

##Exporting animal products and by-products outside the EU

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products outside of the EU. 

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.

###Apply for an EHC

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB).

Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority] to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

Sometimes there won’t be an available EHC for your consignment and destination (eg because of a trade ban, lack of demand or if the negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing.)

Talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

Send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.
