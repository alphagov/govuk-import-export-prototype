You usually need to follow special rules to export bones, skins and other animal by-products.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

There are different rules for animal products:

- from [endangered animals](#endangered-animals)
- that will be [used as food](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html)

$CTA

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

Within the EU (and the UK), you must create a commercial document to move:

* category 1 or category 2 animal by-products - including meat and bone meal (MBM) or animal fat derived from them
* processed animal proteins (PAPs) from category 3 

You can [check how your animal by-product is classified](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal). If you need help, [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#a-z-of-services).

###Create a commercial document

s1. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s2. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the animal by-products ("ABP") you’re exporting.
s3. Your commercial document will be sent to you within xxx days.
s4. Attach the document your consignment when you transport it.

[Question for fact check: how long does it take for the commercial document to be sent to the exporter?]

Instead of using TRACES, you can create your own commercial document. Include details of:

- the animal by-products in your consignment
- your contact information
- the business or person you’re sending your goods to

[Question for SME: Is it possible to create your own commercial document and are the instructions [in the current guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#keepingrecords-and-labelling) correct?}

Follow the rules for [record keeping and labelling](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#keepingrecords-and-labelling).

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491835/contacts-international-trade.pdf).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk (or contact [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You’ll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.


##Transporting animal by-products

Follow the rules for [transporting animal by-products](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transporting-animal-by-products).

##Endangered animals

Use the Species+ tool to [search for the animal](https://www.speciesplus.net/)your by-product is from. Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-the-EU) or [outside the EU](#outside-the-EU).

If Species+ says the animal is banned, you can't export the product. 

###Within the EU

If the animal is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must [apply for an Article 10 certificate](apply-for-an-article-10-certificate).

You don’t need a certificate to export:

- crocodylia skin with source code D
- animal by-products for scientific research or other non-commercial reasons

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 

Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or [post it to the Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. 

You should get your certificate within 15 days.


###Outside the EU


If it's classed as A, B or C, you need a [CITES export permit](apply-for-a-cites-permit).

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a [CITES export permit]. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

If you're re-exporting goods include a CITES import permit to prove it legally entered the EU.

Email or post the completed form to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

###Regular exports for public exhibition

If you regularly take goods abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, [check if you can use a travelling exhibition certificate](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/pdf/referenceguide_en.pdf) instead of a CITES permit. You can use the certificate whether you're moving goods within or outside the EU.

You can add multiple specimen types in one application if needed.

It’s valid for 3 years and means you don't need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​

###Apply

- complete the [application](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-travelling-exhibition-certificate)
- send it to the address on the form

You’ll get your certificate within 15 working days and there’s no fee.

[Question for SME: how regularly must you export to qualify for a certificate?]
