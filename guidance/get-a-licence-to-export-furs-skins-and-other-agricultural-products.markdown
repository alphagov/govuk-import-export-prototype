You need permission to export all animal by-products (ABPs) with a high risk of infection and some processed animal proteins (PAPs) from low-risk ABPs.

You won’t need to follow any special rules if you’re exporting PAPs from:

* milk, colostrum or products derived from them
* gelatine
* collagen
* hydrolysed proteins
* dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate of animal origin
* blood products 

There are different rules for animal by-products that:

- are [from endangered animals](#endangered-animals)
- will be [used as food](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html)

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

You must complete a commercial document to move these animal by-products (ABPs) within the EU.

All category 1 ABPs, including:

* carcasses and all body parts of animals suspected of being infected with TSE(transmissible spongiform encephalopathy)
* carcasses of wild animals suspected of being infected with a disease that humans or animals could contract
* carcasses of animals used in experiments
* parts of animals that are contaminated due to illegal treatments
* international catering waste
* carcasses and body parts from zoo and circus animals or pets
* specified risk material (body parts that pose a particular disease risk, eg cows’ spinal cords)

All category 2 ABPs, including:

* animals rejected from abattoirs due to having infectious diseases
* carcasses containing traces from authorised treatments
* unhatched poultry that has died in its shell
* carcasses of animals killed for disease control purposes
* carcasses of dead livestock
* manure
* digestive tract content

You also need permission to export processed animal proteins (PAP) from category 3:

* carcasses or body parts passed fit for humans to eat, at a slaughterhouse
* products or foods of animal origin originally meant for human consumption but withdrawn for commercial reasons, not because it’s unfit to eat
* domestic catering waste
* shells from shellfish with soft tissue
* aquatic animals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates
* animal hides, skins, hooves, feathers, wool, horns, and hair that had no signs of infectious disease at death

###Complete a commercial document

s1. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)

s2. Fill in the details of animal product you’re exporting 

You should also keep a logbook of your consignments, [fill in the template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/425368/logbook-templates.doc) (MS Word Document, 49KB) or create your own document with the same information.

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491835/contacts-international-trade.pdf).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk (or contact [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You’ll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.



##Endangered animals

[Search for the animal you’re exporting](http://www.speciesplus.net/). It’s endangered if it’s listed as ‘appendix I’.

Within the EU, you usually can’t move by-products from endangered animals except in special cases (like for research necessary for the species to survive). [Contact APHA](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

Outside the EU, you need to:

- check the [list of banned exports](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php) - some animal by-products to certain countries are banned outright
- [apply for a CITES permit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB), if the animal isn’t banned

Send the permit application form by post or email to [APHA](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html#contacts) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland), including the [fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355264/cites-ag-ct-01.pdf) (PDF, 146KB).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application.
