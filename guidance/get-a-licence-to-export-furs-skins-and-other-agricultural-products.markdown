You usually need to follow special rules to export bones, skins and other animal by-products.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

There are different rules for animal by-products:

- from [endangered animals](#endangered-animals)
- that will be [used as food](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html)

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

Within the EU (and the UK), you must create a commercial document to move:

* category 1 or category 2 animal by-products - including meat and bone meal (MBM) or animal fat derived from them
* processed animal proteins (PAPs) from category 3 

You can [check how your animal by-product is classified](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal). If you need help, [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#a-z-of-services).

###Create a commercial document

s1. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s2. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the animal by-products ("ABP") you’re exporting.
s3. Your commercial document will be sent to you within xxx days.
s4. Attach the document your consignment when you transport it.

[Question for fact check: how long does it take for the commercial document to be sent to the exporter?]

Instead of using TRACES, you can create your own commercial document. Include details of:

- the animal by-products in your consignment
- your contact information
- the business or person you’re sending your goods to

[Question for SME: Is it possible to create your own commercial document and are the instructions [in the current guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#keepingrecords-and-labelling) correct?}

Follow the rules for [record keeping and labelling](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#keepingrecords-and-labelling).

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491835/contacts-international-trade.pdf).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk (or contact [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You’ll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

##Transporting animal by-products

Follow the rules for [transporting animal by-products](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transporting-animal-by-products)

##Endangered animals

[Use the tool](http://www.speciesplus.net/) to check if your ABP is listed as an endangered species - if it’s banned outright you can’t export it.

If it’s listed in Annex A you’ll need  'Article 10 certificates' both inside and outside the EU.

The only exceptions are:

* dead Crocodylia species included in Annex A with source code D, with a uniquely marked, closed leg ring
* any animal by-product like skin, bones or shells that have been processed before 1947 for example carved and tinted horns or bones used in an antique art object 

If it’s in any other annex, you’ll also have to get a CITES permit to export your ABP outside the EU. You don’t need to apply for one within the EU but some countries may ask you to prove that 

$CTA  
[Check with APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-bristol) if you’re exporting elephant ivory, rhino horn, tigers and their parts and derivatives, bear bile, bear paws and gallbladders, and eggs of native British birds. You could be fined or imprisoned for up to 7 years if you break the rules.  
$CTA

##Apply for an ‘Article 10 certificate’

Your application must include supporting documents showing the specimen was acquired or imported lawfully. These could be for:  

* imported specimens a copy of the original import permit stamped by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) or the number of that permit  
* specimens previously issued with an Article 10 certificate, the original yellow copy of the certificate
* a specimen taken from the wild, a copy of any licences issued to allow it to be removed from the wild

Complete your [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use). 

Make sure you include your good’s markings correctly (for example it’s tags, microchip numbers or ring number) as this may determine what type of certificate you get.


### If you don’t have supporting documents

If you don’t have any of the supporting documents, you might still be able to get an Article 10 certificate. 

You’ll need to provide other details of the specimen’s origin, for example:

* details of its parents and the breeder’s name
* parents’ certificate numbers
* a copy of an import certificate confirming the specimens were bred in captivity, or imported or acquired lawfully
