You need permission to export animal by-products, for example:

* skins, hides and wool   
* bones, carsasses, blood and gelatin
* manure
* semen, ova, embryos and other germplasm from cattle or pigs 

There are different rules for animal by-products that:

- are [from endangered animals](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html)
- will be [used as food](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html)

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU] or [outside the EU].

##Within the EU

To move animal by-products within the EU, you must:

- apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) for each type of animal by-product
- 


###Apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC)

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection. You must keep it for 3 years.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product, [contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

###Complete a commercial document

You must also fill in a commercial document to move animal by-products within the EU. This is a signed list, including:

* a detailed description of the contents, including category, weight, volume and quantity
* the date of transport
* an address of origin and destination, and contact names at both
* approval or registration numbers for the factory or vehicle
* ear numbers and details of species, where carcasses have been taken from farms

You should keep a copy for at least 2 years.

[Question for SME: Is the commercial document the same thing as a community transit declaration. If so, we can link to the guide rather than reproduce here.]

##Outside the EU

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. Check the [list of EHCs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Note the EHC number of what you’re exporting.
s3. Contact the country you’re exporting to and confirm the EHC will meet their requirements. Also ask if there are any other rules for importing into the country.
s4. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get the application form and a copy of the EHC. Tell them the EHC number you require and the details of your official veterinarian.
s5. Fill in the form and the EHC and return them. The address is on the form. 
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check if your products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.
s7. You may need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.
