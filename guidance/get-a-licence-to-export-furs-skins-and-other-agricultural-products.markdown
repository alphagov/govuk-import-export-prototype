When they've read this page, the user will:

- understand if they need a licence or certificate
- understand how to apply
- understand who to contact if they have a question
- understands how long it takes to get a licence
* understands how much it costs
* understands what they have to do with it once they have a licence

You'll neeed extra documents to export animal products and by-products, this includes:

* skins, wool, leathers and furs    
* semen, ova, embryos from cattle, sheep, goats and pigs - the rules are different if they're from a different animal [link to endangered animal content]    
* bones, carsasses and blood    
* collagen or any animal part used to manufacture drugs   

[Question for SME: Does sheep and goat semen, ova, embryos follow the Balai rules? There seems to be some contradiction]

##Moving animal products within the EU 
You’ll need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC).

You must keep this document for at least 3 years and it'll only be valid for only one species or one type of product at a time.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Use an existing ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

###Nominate a vet
You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

###Moving animal by-products inside the EU
You'll also need to fill in a corporate document - this is a signed list including:

* a description of the goods, eg what they are and how much you’re moving 
* the date you’re transporting them and registration number for the vehicle
* where you’re sending the goods from and who you’re sending them to
* the factory approval or registration number

[Is this just a declaration, if so we can’t link to the guide]

##Exporting animal products outside the EU

You’ll need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal products and by products outside of the EU. 

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.

###Get an existing EHC issued

There will often already be an EHC for the type of animal product or by-product you’re exporting and where you’re exporting it to.

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB) to see if the EHC you need already exists and is available for issue.

If it exists, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority]to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

In some cases, there won’t be an available EHC that covers the type of consignment you want to send and the destination you’re sending it to.

This could be because:

- the EHC you want is on hold - eg due to a trade ban enforced by the destination country
- there hasn’t been any previous demand for an EHC for the animal product you’re exporting to the destination country
- negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing - agreeing new EHCs can take years or stall due to trade barriers

If the EHC you want doesn’t exist, you should talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

You should send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.
