You need a certificate or commercial document to export animal by-products, for example:

* skins,leathers and wool   
* bones, carsasses and blood    
* collagen or any animal part used to manufacture drugs   

You also need a certificate to export animal semen, ova, embryos and other germplasm from cattle, sheep, goats and pigs 

^The rules are different if they're from other animals [link to endangered animal content].^

[Question for SME: Do sheep and goat semen, ova, embryos follow the Balai direction rules? There seems to be some contradiction]

##Within the EU

You need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move germplasm and animal by-products within the EU. You need one for each species or animal product type.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Applying for an ITAHC

Apply by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

Once you have your ITAHC, you must keep it for 3 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> or phone or write to the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester))

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

###If there isn’t an ITAHC for your germplasm or animal by-product

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply.

###Fill in a document to move by-products within the EU

This document is a signed list including:

* a detailed description of the contents, including category, weight, volume and quantity
* the date of transport
* an address of origin and destination, and contact names at both
* approval or registration numbers for the factory or vehicle
* ear numbers and details of species, where carcasses have been taken from farms

You should keep a copy of the commercial document for at least 2 years.

[Question for SME: Is this just a community transit declaration, if so we can link to the guide]

##Outside the EU

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.


###Apply for an EHC

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB).

Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority] to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

Sometimes there won’t be an available EHC for your consignment and destination (eg because of a trade ban or lack of demand).

Talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

Send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.
