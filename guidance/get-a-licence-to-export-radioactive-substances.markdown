It’s a criminal offence to export something on the consolidated military list outside the UK without the right licence.

$CTA

[Download the consolidated military list](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488993/controllist20151225.pdf) (PDF, 3.28MB).

$CTA

The consolidated military list includes:

- radioactive substances (‘radioactive sources’ or ‘radionuclides’) that can be used for military purposes
- ‘dual use’ radioactive substances - substances that can be used for military or civilian purposes (for example, in research, medicine industry or agriculture)
- other goods, technology or services that could make it possible to use a radioactive substance for military purposes (eg technology or training manuals)

‘Dual use’ items can be raw materials, components or finished systems.

## Exporting substances that aren’t on the consolidated military list

You must contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO) if you find out that something you’re exporting will be used for military purposes, even if it doesn’t appear on the consolidated military list. For example, components that will be used to make a weapon or weapon of mass destruction.

These are called ‘end use’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

You must apply for an export licence if ECO tells you to.

[Question for SME: does the military end use control apply to anything that will be used for military purposes - or is it only if the end product will be exported to an embargoed country?]

## Apply for an export licence

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

ECO sometimes need to check licence applications with the government of the country you’re exporting to. So apply as far in advance as possible.

[Question for SME: is there a guideline on how far in advance to apply?]

The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

When deciding whether to give a licence, ECO will consider:

- whether there’s a risk of the substances being used for terrorism (based on any intelligence available to ECO, the end user’s track record, the importing state’s views about the risk and the importing state’s ability to regulate the risk)
- whether the exporter follows the [IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.asp)
- whether the importing country has any relevant import bans in place

##Taking radioactive substances out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take something that’s on the consolidated military list out of the country temporarily.

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

## Sharing classified information

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means:

- information or equipment classified as [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- information or equipment classified as ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.


[Question for SME: does the requirement to complete MOD form 680 apply here?]

## Trafficking and brokering

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the consolidated military list.

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one country to another. For example:

- arranging or negotiating sales
- arranging intra company transfers
- drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

[Question for SME: are these the applicable rules on trafficking and brokering?]

## When you have your licence

You are responsible for making sure that your licence is still valid when you export the goods.

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your licence when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/).

The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

- what records to keep
- what compliance processes to put in place
- how to train staff
- how ECO compliance audits work
