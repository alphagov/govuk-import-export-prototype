The UK strategic export control lists include:

- radioactive substances (‘radioactive sources’ or ‘radionuclides’) that can be used for military purposes
- ‘dual use’ radioactive substances - substances that can be used for military or civilian purposes (for example, in research, medicine industry or agriculture)
- other goods, technology or services that could make it possible to use a radioactive substance for military purposes (eg technology, software, training manuals, diagrams or blueprints)

You’ll need a licence for information in any form. For example print, email, telephone, text message or electronic file transfers or carrying a laptop abroad containing information about controlled technology.

You must apply for a licence if the government tells you that you need one.

^If you’re exporting goods that are being picked directly from your place of work by your customer (‘ex-works goods’), tell them to check if they need an export licence.

##When you need an export licence

If you don’t get a licence for items that need one your goods will be delayed at customs. They could be confiscated and you could be fined or prosecuted.

Use the [goods checker](https://www.ecochecker.trade.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to determine if your goods are on the UK strategic export control lists, and how they’re categorised.

Or [download a copy of the UK strategic export control lists](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-strategic-export-control-lists-the-consolidated-list-of-strategic-military-and-dual-use-items-that-require-export-authorisation).

You must have a licence to supply anything on the UK strategic export control lists to someone based outside the UK, unless you’re exporting:

* most dual use items to EU countries or the Channel Islands
* goods owned by the Ministry of Defence

You still need an export licence to [take radioactive substances out of the UK temporarily](#taking-radioactive-substances-out-of-the-UK-temporarily).

##Exporting dual use items to EU countries

If your items are categorised as ‘Schedule 3 UK controlled dual-use, software and technology’ in the goods checker, you may not need a licence unless they’re listed in [Annex IV of EU Dual Use Regulation 428/2009](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:134:0001:0269:en:PDF#page=260).

You don’t need a licence to export dual use items to the Channel Islands.

Even if your items don’t need a licence, the customs and transport documents must state that the items can only be moved outside the EU with an export licence.

##Exporting goods owned by the Ministry of Defence

You don’t need a licence to export goods owned by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD).

Instead, get an approval letter from the Export Control Joint Unit in the MOD. Email ECJU-MODTeam@mod.uk for details.

## Goods that you can't get a licence for

Even if your items wouldn’t usually need a licence, you must must not export, traffic or broker the movement of any items, services or technology if you find out they might be used:

* for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) purposes (for example, technology that might be used in a nuclear weapons facility)
* for military purposes in an an [embargoed country](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#how-eco-decides-whether-to-give-licences)

This includes 'technical assistance' - for example, assembly, maintenance or repair services. 

These are called ‘end use’, ‘end user’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

If you’ve any concerns about your end user, [use the SPIRE service](https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to request end user advice from the Export Control Organisation (ECO). You must apply for a licence if the ECO or HMRC tells you to.

## Apply for an export licence

Before you apply for an export licence, check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [research legal rules in overseas markets](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

$CTA

There’s no charge for a licence. You can read guidance on [how to use the SPIRE service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spire-online-export-licensing-guidance).

[ECO statistics data has information on how long licence applications usually take based on the country you’re sending your goods to.

##Taking radioactive substances out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take a radioactive substance out of the country temporarily.

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

##Additional forms you may need to complete your licence application

When you apply through the SPIRE service, you’ll be told whether you need to complete any additional forms.

You can find links to the forms in [the guidance to using SPIRE](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spire-online-export-licensing-guidance).

##How ECO decides whether to give licences

ECO sometimes needs to check licence applications with the government of the country you’re exporting to. 

When deciding whether to give a licence, ECO will consider whether there’s a risk of the substances being used for terrorism based on:

* any intelligence available to ECO  
* the end user’s track record
* the importing state’s views about the risk and their ability to regulate the risk (and whether they have import bans in place)

They will also check that you’ve followed the [IAEA Code of Conduct.](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.asp)

##Brokering radioactive substances

Brokering (known as ‘trade controls’) can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating contracts
* arranging or providing freight or transport services
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

###Brokering to embargoed countries

There are tighter controls on brokering for some goods and for some locations.

For goods where there’s a total ban on UK exports or countries where there’s a UK embargo in place, brokering also includes: 

* general advertising and promotion (eg placing advertisements)
* finance, financial services, insurance or reinsurance services
* contract promotion activity

## Your licence responsibilities

You'll get an electronic copy of your licence through the SPIRE system.

You must include a copy of the licence with the shipping paperwork. If you’re posting the goods, you must include a copy of the licence in a separate envelope, attached to the package.

You are responsible for making sure that your export licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters).

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could be fined or prosecuted.

### If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) 

If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL), [check the terms of your OGEL](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels).

### If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)

If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL), you must:

* [contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) in advance to arrange an inspection of your goods (goods must be available for inspection at least 3 days before the export date)
* keep records of end user details

## ECO compliance visits

ECO carries out regular compliance visits to make sure licence holders follow the correct processes. The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

* what records to keep
* what compliance processes to put in place
* how to train staff
* how compliance audits work

## Sharing classified information during the export process

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means information or equipment classified as:

- [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.
