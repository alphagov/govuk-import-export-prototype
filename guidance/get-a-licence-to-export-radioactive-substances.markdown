It’s a criminal offence to export something on the consolidated military list of strategic military and dual use items (known as the 'consolidated list') outside the UK unless you have the right licence.

$CTA

[Check the consolidated list using the Goods Checker tool](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to see if you need a licence.

$CTA

The consolidated list includes:

- radioactive substances (‘radioactive sources’ or ‘radionuclides’) that can be used for military purposes
- ‘dual use’ radioactive substances - substances that can be used for military or civilian purposes (for example, in research, medicine industry or agriculture)
- other goods, technology or services that could make it possible to use a radioactive substance for military purposes (eg technology, software or training manuals)

‘Dual use’ items can be raw materials, components or finished systems.

The rules for radioactive substances apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

## Exporting substances that aren’t on the consolidated list

You must contact the [Export Control Organisation (ECO)](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-radioactive-substances.html#contact-the-export-control-organisation-eco) if you find out that something you’re exporting will be used for military purposes or to make a weapon of mass destruction (WMD), even if it doesn’t appear on the consolidated military list. For example, components that will be used to make a weapon.

These are called ‘end use’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

You must apply for an export licence if ECO tells you to.

## Apply for an export licence

Before you apply for an export licence, check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [research legal rules in overseas markets](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

ECO sometimes needs to check licence applications with the government of the country you’re exporting to. 

Apply as far in advance as possible, [you can check](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk)how long licence applications usually take.

There's no charge for a licence.

When deciding whether to give a licence, ECO will consider whether there’s a risk of the substances being used for terrorism based on:

* any intelligence available to ECO  
* the end user’s track record
* the importing state’s views about the risk and their ability to regulate the risk (and whether they have import bans in place)

They will also check that you’ve followed the [IAEA Code of Conduct.](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.asp)

##Taking radioactive substances out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take a radioactive substance out of the country temporarily.

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

## Trafficking and brokering radioactive substances

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the consolidated list.

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one country to another. For example:

- arranging or negotiating sales
- arranging intra company transfers
- drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

## Your license responsibilities

You're responsible for making sure that your licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Check the [ECO notices to exporters](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters) to keep up to date.

The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

- what records to keep
- what compliance processes to put in place
- how to train staff
- how ECO compliance audits work

### Sharing classified information during the export process

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means information or equipment classified as:

- [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.
