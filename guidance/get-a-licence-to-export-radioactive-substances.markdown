It can be a criminal offence to export something on the UK strategic export control lists
outside the UK unless you have the right licence.

$CTA

[Check the consolidated list using the Goods Checker tool](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to see if you need a licence.

$CTA

The UK strategic export control lists include:

- radioactive substances (‘radioactive sources’ or ‘radionuclides’) that can be used for military purposes
- ‘dual use’ radioactive substances - substances that can be used for military or civilian purposes (for example, in research, medicine industry or agriculture)
- other goods, technology or services that could make it possible to use a radioactive substance for military purposes (eg technology, software, training manuals, diagrams or blueprints)

This includes information in any form. For example print, email, telephone or electronic file transfer.

‘Dual use’ items can be raw materials, components or finished systems.

The rules for radioactive substances apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

## Goods that don’t usually need a licence

Even if your items wouldn’t usually need a licence, you must must not export, traffic or broker the movement of any items, services or technology if you find out they might be used:

* for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) purposes (for example, technology that might be used in a nuclear weapons facility)
* for military purposes in an an [embargoed country](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html#how-eco-decides-whether-to-give-licences)

This includes 'technical assistance' - for example, assembly, maintenance or repair services. 

These are called ‘end use’, ‘end user’ or ‘catch all’ controls.

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to request end user advice from the Export Control Organisation (ECO).

You must apply for a licence if ECO tells you to.

## Apply for an export licence

Before you apply for an export licence, check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [research legal rules in overseas markets](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

## After you apply

ECO sometimes needs to check licence applications with the government of the country you’re exporting to. 

Apply as far in advance as possible, [you can check](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk)how long licence applications usually take.

There's no charge for a licence.

When deciding whether to give a licence, ECO will consider whether there’s a risk of the substances being used for terrorism based on:

* any intelligence available to ECO  
* the end user’s track record
* the importing state’s views about the risk and their ability to regulate the risk (and whether they have import bans in place)

They will also check that you’ve followed the [IAEA Code of Conduct.](http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/radiation-safety/code-of-conduct.asp)

##Taking radioactive substances out of the UK temporarily

You still need to get an export licence to take a radioactive substance out of the country temporarily.

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a temporary export licence.

## Trafficking and brokering radioactive substances

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering anything that appears on the UK strategic export control lists.

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating contracts
* arranging or providing freight or transport services
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

Use the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for a trade control licence.

### Trafficking or brokering to embargoed countries

There are tighter controls on trafficking or brokering for some goods and for some locations.

For countries where there’s a UK embargo in place, trafficking and brokering also includes: 

* general advertising and promotion (eg placing advertisements)
* finance, financial services, insurance or reinsurance services
* contract promotion activity

## Your licence responsibilities

You'll get an electronic copy of your licence through the SPIRE system.

You must include a copy of the licence with the shipping paperwork. If you’re posting the goods, you must include a copy of the licence in a separate envelope, attached to the package.

You are responsible for making sure that your export licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/exportcontrol/).

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could be fined or prosecuted.

### If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) 

If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL), [check the terms of your OGEL](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels).

### If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)

If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL), you must:

* [contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) in advance to arrange an inspection of your goods (goods must be available for inspection at least 3 days before the export date)
* keep records of end user details

## ECO compliance visits

ECO carries out regular compliance visits to make sure licence holders follow the correct processes. The [ECO compliance code of practice](/government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice) has guidance on:

* what records to keep
* what compliance processes to put in place
* how to train staff
* how compliance audits work

## Sharing classified information during the export process

You must get approval from the Ministry of Defence (MOD) before sharing classified information or equipment with a person or organisation outside the UK. This means information or equipment classified as:

- [‘official-sensitive’ or higher](/government/publications/government-security-classifications)
- ‘official’ - but only if it’s connected with other information or equipment that’s classified as ‘official-sensitive’ or higher

Use MOD form 680 on the [SPIRE system](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for approval.

Contact your usual desk officer or email <ACP-ELC@mod.uk> if you have a question about MOD form 680 applications.
