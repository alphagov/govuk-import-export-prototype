You may need a licence to export certain ‘cultural goods’ over 50 years old. Whether you need a licence depends on the value of the goods.

Cultural goods include:

- works of art
- furniture
- antiques
- means of transport
- manuscripts
- archaeological items

You need a licence if you’re exporting something inside or outside the European Union (EU). 

^You need a licence to export cultural goods on a temporary basis.^ 

##What you need to do

[Read the Art Council’s guidance](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-museums/cultural-property/export-controls/export-licensing/) to check if you need a licence.

##What happens next

Your application may be passed to an expert adviser in a national museum or gallery. If they are against the export on the grounds of national importance, your application will be sent to the Reviewing Committee.

The committee will recommend whether the decision should be put on hold to let a UK institution or individual raise funds to buy the item.

You should get a decision within 20 days of your application being received.

If your application for an export licence is accepted, you may need to follow certain conditions.
