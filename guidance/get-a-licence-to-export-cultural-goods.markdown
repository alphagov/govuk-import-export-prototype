You may need a licence to export certain ‘cultural goods’ over 50 years old. Whether you need a licence depends on the age and value of the goods.

Cultural goods include:

- works of art
- furniture
- antiques
- means of transport
- manuscripts
- archaeological items

You need a licence if you’re exporting something inside or outside the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea). 

You need a licence to export cultural goods on a temporary basis.

There’s a [ban on supplying art works, collectors’ pieces and antiques to North Korea](/guidance/exporting-luxury-goods-north-korea.html).

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##What you need to do

Read the Art Council’s [guidance](http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/supporting-museums/cultural-property/export-controls/export-licensing/) to check if you need a licence. 

##How to apply

s1. Contact the [Export Licensing Unit](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-cultural-goods.html#contact) to get an application form.
s2. Complete your application and send it to the Export Licensing Unit. You may need to give extra information, such as a photograph of the item or details of its origin. 

You need to provide supporting documents with your application, like:

* proof of import - if the object arrived in the UK in the past 50 years
* full 'provenance' (documentation which confirms it's authentic) and a photograph - if the object has been in the UK for the past 50 years or longer.

If you plan to export an item temporarily, you must include the date it will return to the UK on the application.

##What happens next

Your application may be passed to an expert adviser in a national museum or gallery. If they're against the export on the grounds of national importance, your application will be sent to the Reviewing Committee.

The committee will recommend whether the decision should be put on hold to let a UK institution or individual raise funds to buy the item.

You should get a decision within 28 days of your application being received.

If your application for an export licence is accepted, you may need to follow certain conditions.
