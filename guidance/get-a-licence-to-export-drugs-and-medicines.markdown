##Controlled drugs
{:#controlled-drugs}

[Check the controlled drugs list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation).

If your drug is not on the list but you think it might have the properties of a controlled substance, [contact the Home Office](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Default.aspx).

If your drug is controlled, you need to apply for a [Home Office controlled drug licence](#apply-export-licence) to export it.

$CTA

You must already have a domestic licence before you export, if you don't, [apply for one](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/controlled-drugs-licences-fees-and-returns#applying-for-a-licence-companies).

##Drugs that can be used for lethal injections
{:#lethal-injections}

You need a licence to export the following barbiturates outside of the EU:

- amobarbital (CAS RN 57-43-2)
- amobarbital sodium salt (CAS RN 64-43-7)
- pentobarbital (CAS RN 76-74-4)
- pentobarbital sodium salt (CAS 57-33-0)

- thiopental (CAS RN 76-75-5)
- thiopental sodium salt (CAS RN 71-73-8), also known as thiopentone sodium

Raw materials that include these barbiturates that require further processing don’t need a licence.

[Question for SME: Our understanding is that controls are intended to apply to finished products - for instance, if they’re packaged for human or veterinary use. It is not intended that they should apply to raw materials or to intermediate products. Please can you confirm?]

You need a licence to export propofol to the US. Your application will be refused if either:

- the stated use of the drug is execution
- the Export Control Organisation (ECO) considers that there is an unacceptable risk the drug will be diverted for use in execution

###Apply for a licence

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.


##Medicines 
{:#medicines}

To export veterinary and human medicines you must:

- check you have a drug manufacturer, wholesale dealer or marketing licence - if you don’t, [apply for the licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences)
- check if you need an export certificate - contact your importer or the government in the destination country to find out

If you need an export certificate, how you apply depends on whether you’re exporting.

How you apply for the certificate depends on whether you’re exporting:

- [medicine for humans](#human-medicines)
- [medicine for animals](#animal-medicines)

You don't need a certificate to export medicines for humans or animals within the EU.

There are additional rules if your medicine is [coated in or contains animal products](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html#meat-dairy-animal-products) like gelatine.

[Question for food/agri SME: is the line above accurate? To which countries does this apply?]

You don’t need one of these licences for ‘over the counter’ veterinary medicines classed as 'AVM-GSL'. You can check classifications on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) [product information database](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/Search.aspx).

[Question for SME:  Is it correct that you do need authorisation if you're a wholesaler? Please can you clarify the term 'over the counter'?]

$CTA

###Defra-2

The Defra-2 certificate and information that comes with it (the ‘schedule’) show that the product is authorised for sale and supply in the UK.

###Defra-1 and Defra-3

Both Defra-1 and Defra-3 show:

- the product is manufactured in the UK
- the product meets good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements
- the UK administrative address
- the UK manufacturing site addresses
- the authorised operations at the UK manufacturing sites


For Defra-1, you fill in a schedule that lets you give addititional specific information about your export. You don't have this option with Defra-3.

###Defra-4

Defra-4 shows both:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that active substances in your product are available in a UK-authorised product

###Defra-SFA

Defra-SFA is for specified feed additives (SFA). It can show either:

- the same things as in the Defra-1 and Defra-3 certificates
- that your product is UK-authorised
 
Say which you'd like the certificate to show when you apply.

##Apply for an animal medicine export certificate

For Defra-SFA, you have to [apply by email](#apply-email).

The importing country may need more information about your export.

###If you need extra information on the certificate
{:#extra-information}

Some countries need information that is not on the standard certificates or schedule templates.

When you apply, you can ask for this information to be included for Defra-1, 2, or 4 certificates, but you must also include some [standard wording](#wording) in your application.

You can also ask for the following to be attached to your export documentation:

- manufacturing authorisation
- a summary of product characteristics (SPC) or product literature (or both)
- a marketing authorisation certificate
- Spanish or French versions of your documents
 
[Question for SME: What does someone do with the certificate when they've got it? Attach it to their consignment?]

###Other ways to apply
{:#apply-email}

[Question for SME: With the exception of Defra-SFA, why would someone apply by email? Do many people use this route?]

You can apply by emailing <exportcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk>.

Include:

- a covering letter on headed paper
- an email address for the invoice to be sent to
- if you’re not the manufacturer, a letter from them giving permission for their details to be used in your application (Defra-1, 3 or 4 only)
- a completed ‘schedule’ template (not required for Defra-3)

A schedule gives specific information about your export. Download and fill in one of the following:

- [Defra-1 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421321/758549_Defra1_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 19KB)
- [Defra-2 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421323/761073_Defra2_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.5KB)
- [Defra-4 schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421325/765798_Defra4_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 18.3KB)
- [Defra-SFA schedule template](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/421326/766188_DefraSFA_ScheduleTemplate.docx) (MS Word Document, 16.5KB)

In the schedule, you can include that the product is ‘free from ingredients of a ruminant origin’ (if requested by the importing country). You must make it clear that the statement is made by you and not the VMD.

###Standard wording
{:#wording}

If you need [extra information](#extra-information) on the certificate, you must also include the appropriate standard wording.

Defra-1 and 4 wording:

> The VMD stamp and signature on this page confirm the site is GMP compliant and holds a Manufacturing Authorisation. It does not independently verify any of the other information contained on this page. The Qualified Person at the site named on page one is responsible for the veracity and validity of the other information on this document.

Defra-2 wording:

> The VMD stamp and signature on this page confirm the veterinary medicines named on
page two hold a Marketing Authorisation in the same name. It does not independently verify any of the other information contained on this page.
