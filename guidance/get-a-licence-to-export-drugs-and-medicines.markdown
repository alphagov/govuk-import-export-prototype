You can export a medicine if you have a drug [manufacturer licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences).

If you want to export a medicine that you haven’t manufactured, you’ll need a [wholesaler dealer licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences).

You can’t export unlicensed human medicines manufactured under a [specials licence](/government/publications/supply-unlicensed-medicinal-products-specials) to a country outside of the [European Economic Area](/eu-eea).

##Export certificates

You may be asked to provide an export certificate depending on which country you’re exporting to. You must talk to the importer who’s receiving your goods to find out if you need an export certificate.

There are 5 types of export certificate.

##Apply for an export licence


Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.


The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.


##Export controlled drugs to the Channel Islands

You’ll need an additional licence to export controlled drugs to the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey). 

If you export 24 or more shipments in a 12 month period you can [apply for a time-limited blanket export licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-export-to-channel-islands). The licence will be valid for up to a year.

If you export less than 24 shipments in a 12 month period you’ll need to [apply for an export licence](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login).

Occasional exporters will need to apply for individual export authorisations for each consignment. 

[SME question: What is the threshold for an occasional exporter?]

You must send a valid import permit from the competent authority with your application.

[SME question: Where do you send your permit?]

####Schedule 1 controlled drugs

Each shipment of schedule 1 controlled drugs will require:

- an individual export authorisation application
- a valid import permit from the relevant authorities in the country where you’re exporting to
- a domestic export licence

[SME question: how do users get an individual export authorisation application and a domestic export licence?]

####Renewing your licence

You’ll need to renew your licence at least 4 weeks before it expires.

####Monthly returns of exports

Exporters should complete the Channel Islands export monthly return form which must be sent to Channel_Islands@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.
 
Holders of frequent exporter licences must submit a monthly return form detailing the actual substances that have been shipped.

If you have not shipped for one month or more, then a nil return is required for each month that you have not shipped. If no monthly return form is received to cover each month you have held a licence, then your licence may be suspended.
