You'll need a licence to export ‘controlled drugs’ that:

* [have similar compounds or effects to class A, B and C illegal drugs](#export-drugs-which-could-be-misused), for example, opioids, stimulants or psycoactive substances
* [could be used in lethal injections](#export-barbituates-which-could-be-used-for-lethal-injections) - these are called barbiturates

There are separate rules if you’re exporting [any type of controlled drug to the Channel Islands](exporting-controlled-drugs to-the-channel-islands) or [propafol to the US](##export-propofol-to-the-US).


$CTA

If you’re exporting drugs which only have medical use for humans, you’ll need an export certificate

Once you’re registered, [log into your account](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/DrugsConsole.ofml) to apply for a licence.

If your application is successful, licences are usually sent out within 10 working days.

[SME question: How much does this licence cost? Whar can they do if they haven't got a decision after 16 weeks? How lomng is this licence valid for?]

###Apply for a National Drugs control System export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

You’ll also need to [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) to apply for an export licence from the National Drugs control System (NDS).

You must submit a copy of the import permit from the country you’re importing to.

Your licence will be valid for up to 2 months. If the import licence of the country you’re exporting to is valid for less than 2 months, your licence will be issued for the same length of time.

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24.

DLCU will email you an invoice.

If you need a purchase order number to be quoted on the invoice, please state this when you apply or email [DLCUfees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk](DLCUCommsOfficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk).

##Export barbituates which could be used for lethal injections

You need permission from the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to export outside the EU some drugs that may be used in lethal injections. These are ‘short and intermediate acting barbiturate anaesthetic agents’.

This applies to drugs that are packaged for human or veterinary use, not raw materials that require further processing. The drugs are:

- amobarbital (CAS RN 57-43-2)
- amobarbital sodium salt (CAS RN 64-43-7)
- pentobarbital (CAS RN 76-74-4)
- pentobarbital sodium salt (CAS 57-33-0)
- secobarbital (CAS RN 76-73-3)
- secobarbital sodium salt (CAS RN 309-43-3)
- thiopental (CAS RN 76-75-5)
- thiopental sodium salt (CAS RN 71-73-8), also known as thiopentone sodium

##Export propofol to the US

You’ll need a licence from ECO to export propofol from the UK to the US. 

ECO will refuse any application if either:

- the stated use of the drug is execution
- ECO considers that there is an unacceptable risk the drug will be diverted for use in execution

###Apply for an export licence

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.


The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.


##Exporting controlled drugs to the Channel Islands

You’ll need an additional licence to export controlled drugs to the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey). 

If you export 24 or more shipments in a 12 month period you can [apply for a time-limited blanket export licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-export-to-channel-islands). The licence will be valid for up to a year.

If you export less than 24 shipments in a 12 month period you’ll need to [apply for an export licence](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login).

Occasional exporters will need to apply for individual export authorisations for each consignment. 

[SME question: What is the threshold for an occasional exporter?]

You must send a valid import permit from the competent authority with your application.

[SME question: Where do you send your permit?]

####Renew your licence

You’ll need to renew your licence at least 4 weeks before it expires.

####Monthly returns of exports

Exporters should complete the Channel Islands export monthly return form which must be sent to Channel_Islands@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.
 
Holders of frequent exporter licences must submit a monthly return form detailing the actual substances that have been shipped.

You'll need to do a nil return for each month that you've not shipped for over a month. Your licence may be suspended if you don't send a monthly return form for each month you've held a licence.
