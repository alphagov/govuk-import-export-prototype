You'll need a licence to export ‘controlled drugs’ that:

* [have similar compounds or effects to class A, B and C illegal drugs](#export-drugs-which-could-be-misused), for example opioids, stimulants or psychoactive substances
* [could be used in lethal injections](#export-barbituates-which-could-be-used-for-lethal-injections) - these are called barbiturates

There are extra rules for exports to the [Channel Islands](#channel-islands) or of [propafol to the US](##export-propofol-to-the-US).

Drugs that have a [medical use for humans or animals](#medicines) might also need to get an export certificate. 

$CTA

You could need a licence and a certificate for the same drug if you're exporting a medicine which could be misused.

$CTA

##Export drugs which could be misused

[Refer to the list of drug which are commonly used misused](/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2).

[Contact the Home Office](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Default.aspx) if your drug doesn't feature but you think it might have the properties of a controlled substance.

$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html)

###Apply for a controlled drugs licence
{:#apply-licence}

[Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/drugs_registration.ofml) before you apply for a controlled drugs licence.

Once you’re registered, [log into your account](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/DrugsConsole.ofml) to apply for a licence.

If your application is successful, licences are usually sent out within 10 working days.

[SME question: How much does this licence cost? What can they do if they haven't got a decision after 16 weeks? How long is this licence valid for?]

###Apply for a National Drugs control System export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

You’ll also need to [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) to apply for an export licence from the National Drugs control System (NDS).

You must submit a copy of the import permit from the country you’re importing to.

Your licence will be valid for up to 2 months. If the import licence of the country you’re exporting to is valid for less than 2 months, your licence will be issued for the same length of time.

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24.

DLCU will email you an invoice.

If you need a purchase order number to be quoted on the invoice, please state this when you apply or email [DLCUfees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk](DLCUCommsOfficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk).

##Export barbituates which could be used for lethal injections

You need permission from the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to export outside the EU some drugs that may be used in lethal injections. These are ‘short and intermediate acting barbiturate anaesthetic agents’.

This applies to drugs that are packaged for human or veterinary use, not raw materials that require further processing. The drugs are:

- amobarbital (CAS RN 57-43-2)
- amobarbital sodium salt (CAS RN 64-43-7)
- pentobarbital (CAS RN 76-74-4)
- pentobarbital sodium salt (CAS 57-33-0)
- secobarbital (CAS RN 76-73-3)
- secobarbital sodium salt (CAS RN 309-43-3)
- thiopental (CAS RN 76-75-5)
- thiopental sodium salt (CAS RN 71-73-8), also known as thiopentone sodium

##Export propofol to the US

You’ll need a licence from ECO to export propofol from the UK to the US. 

ECO will refuse any application if either:

- the stated use of the drug is execution
- ECO considers that there is an unacceptable risk the drug will be diverted for use in execution

###Apply for an export licence

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.


The [ECO reports and statistics website](https://www.exportcontroldb.bis.gov.uk) has information on how long licence applications usually take.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a licence?]

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.


##Channel Islands
{:#channel-islands}

You’ll need an additional licence to export controlled drugs to the Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey). 

If you export 24 or more shipments in a 12 month period you can [apply for a time-limited blanket export licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-export-to-channel-islands). The licence will be valid for up to a year.

If you export less than 24 shipments in a 12 month period you’ll need to [apply for an export licence](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login).

Occasional exporters will need to apply for individual export authorisations for each consignment. 

[SME question: What is the threshold for an occasional exporter?]

You must send a valid import permit from the competent authority with your application.

[SME question: Where do you send your permit?]

####Renew your licence

You’ll need to renew your licence at least 4 weeks before it expires.

####Monthly returns of exports

Exporters should complete the Channel Islands export monthly return form which must be sent to Channel_Islands@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.
 
Holders of frequent exporter licences must submit a monthly return form detailing the actual substances that have been shipped.

You'll need to do a nil return for each month that you've not shipped for over a month. Your licence may be suspended if you don't send a monthly return form for each month you've held a licence.
