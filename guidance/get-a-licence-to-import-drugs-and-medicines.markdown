- a pharmacist in a hospital, health centre or registered pharmacy
- a wholesale dealer licensed for supply to the order of any of the above
- a manufacturer licensed for import for supply to the order of any of the above

- an [EEA member state](#within the EEA) (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein)
- [outside the EEA](#Outside the EEA)

s1. Special Import Certificate (SIC) for EU authorised veterinary medicinal products
s2. Special Treatment Certificate (STC) for all other products.
s3. Wholesale Dealers Import Certificate (WDIC) for wholesalers who import and hold medicinal products that are then supplied to the holder of an SIC or STC.
s4. Research Import Certificate (RIC). for project licence holders who need a product or substance for licenced use in research performed under the Animal (Scientific Procedure) Act (A(SP)A).

###STCs

You must submit an application each individual animal. An application for a group of animals such as a herd or flock on the same treatment may be submitted as one application; however, a group of horses is not regarded as a herd.
