[Question for SME: does the 'Apply for a controlled drugs licence' section at https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#apply-licence apply to imports?]

##Controlled drugs
{:#controlled-drugs}

If your drug is not on the list but you think it might have the properties of a controlled substance, [contact the Home Office](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Default.aspx).

###Apply for a licence

If your drug is on the list you need to:

- [register for a National Drugs control System (NDS) account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx)

##Human medicines
{:#human-medicines}

###If you’ll supply the medicines in the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea)(EEA).

You need a [wholesaler licence](#wholesaler-licence) if you’re importing from within the EEA.

If you’re importing from outside the EEA, you need a [manufacturer’s licence](#manufacturers-licence) instead.

###If you’re importing to export outside the EEA

You need a wholesaler licence if you’re importing from outside the EEA.

Otherwise you don’t need a licence.

[If you supply medicines in the UK that you've imported from outside the EEA, is it really correct that you don't need a wholesaler licence? This appears to contradict https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences which says 'to sell or supply medicines to anyone other than the patient using the medicine, you need a wholesaler licence']

##If you need to apply for a licence

Fill in application forms for:

- the [wholesaler dealer's licence](#wholesalers-licence)
- [manufacturer's licence](#manufacturers-licence], if you need to

Send your form (or forms) to xxx at least 28 days.

If your medicine is authorised, you can apply for a certificate.

There are 4 types of import certificates:

s1. Special Import Certificate (SIC) for EU authorised veterinary medicinal products
s2. Special Treatment Certificate (STC) for all other products.
s3. Wholesale Dealers Import Certificate (WDIC) for wholesalers who import and hold medicinal products that are then supplied to the holder of an SIC or STC.
s4. Research Import Certificate (RIC). for project licence holders who need a product or substance for licenced use in research performed under the Animal (Scientific Procedure) Act (A(SP)A).

###SIC and STC
