You need permission to import:

- [controlled drugs](#Controlled-drugs) like opioids, stimulants or psychotropic substances
- [medicines for humans](#Human-medicines) or [animals](#Veterinary-medicines)

[Question for SME: does the 'Apply for a controlled drugs licence' section at https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#apply-licence apply to imports?]

##Controlled drugs
{:#controlled-drugs}

[Check the controlled drugs list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation)

If your drug is not on the list but you think it might have the properties of a controlled substance, [contact the Home Office](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Default.aspx).

###Apply for a licence

If your drug is on the list you need to:

- [register for a National Drugs control System (NDS) account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx)
- apply for a [Home Office Controlled Drugs Licence](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/drugs_registration.ofml)

Existing licensees without a password should contact [DFLU.dom@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:DFLU.dom@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk).

It can take up to 16 weeks for your application to be processed. The licence is valid for 3 months.

###Fees

Each licence costs £24. You pay for it advance and it can only be used for one shipment. You when you apply, you must upload copies of your prescription and letter.

##Human medicines
{:#human-medicines}

What you need to do depends on what you're importing and where you're sending it.

Make sure you have a [wholesaler licence](#wholesaler-licence) if you import medicines from:

-  the [European Economic Area](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) (EEA)
 and then supply a country within it
-  outside the EEA and supply them to a country outside the EEA

You need a manufacturer’s licence instead if you’re importing from outside the EEA to supply to an EEA country.

Otherwise, you don’t need a licence

[If you supply medicines in the UK that you've imported from outside the EEA, is it correct that you don't need a wholesaler licence? This appears to contradict https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences which says 'to sell or supply medicines to anyone other than the patient using the medicine, you need a wholesaler licence']

###If you need to apply for a licence

For a wholesale dealer's licence you should:

- [complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473221/Notification_of_intent_to_import_-_application_form.xls)

For a manufacturer's licence you should:

- [complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/366681/Full_Manufacturers_Specials_licence.doc)

You then need to email your form to [imports@mhra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto: imports@mhra.gsi.gov.uk) at least 28 days before you import.

[Question for SME: which accompanying documents do importers need to submit?]

##Unlicensed medicines

What you need to do to import unlicensed medicines depends on if you're importing from within or from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

###Within the EEA

To import from within the EEA, you need a wholesale dealer's licence [wholesale dealer's licence](#wholesale-licence)

###Outside the EEA

To import from outside the EEA, you need a [manufacturer's specials licence](#specials-licence)

[SME question: what defines these patients’ special needs?]

You can import unlicensed medicines if you’re:

- a doctor or dentist registered in the UK
- a supplementary prescriber (for example, an appropriately qualified nurse or pharmacist)
- an independent prescriber (as a nurse or pharmacist)
- a pharmacist in a hospital, health centre or registered pharmacy
- a wholesale dealer licensed for supply to the order of any of the above
- a manufacturer licensed for import for supply to the order of any of the above

###Apply for a 'specials' licence
{:#specials-licence}

[Complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/366681/Full_Manufacturers_Specials_licence.doc).

###Urgent imports

In cases of clinical emergency (usually the treatment of life-threatening illness or where significant injury is likely) MHRA is able to process an import notification within one working day.

Contact the import notifications supervisor on 020 3080 7002 or call 020 3080 6000.

For urgent cases out of office hours, you should contact the MHRA duty officer on 07795 641532.

[SME question: How long does an import notification usually take (if not urgent)?]

##Fees

Fees are charged annually, based on the number of notifications you submit. MHRA provide an an early estimate in the financial year, followed by an invoice for the whole year.

[Question for SME: How are customer's provided with the estimate?]

Number of estimated notifications 	| Annual fee (£)
-|-
1 to 20 | 130
21 to 100 | 519
101 to 1,000 | 2,077
1,001 to 5,000 | 10,383
5,001 to 20,000 | 25,957
20,001 to 50,000 | 51,914
50,001 to 100,000 | 103,828
Over 100,001 | 155,742

##TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies)

If your products contain TSE risk materials, you must allow them to be assessed. The importer is responsible for any assessments required. 

[SME question:Who does the assessment and how do importers organise this?]

##Veterinary medicines
{:Veterinary-medicines}

How you get a certificate depends on whether you're importing an EU-authorised medicine.

Use the [Product Information Database](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/) to find out if your medicine is authorised.

If you’re a veterinary surgeon you’ll need one of the following:

- a Special Import Certificate (SIC) for veterinary medicine
- a Special Treatment Certificate (STC) for medicine or medicinal products from outside the EU 
- a Wholesale Dealer’s Certificate (WDIC) to import and hold products that are then supplied to a SIC or STC holder

If you're a researcher, you should:
 
- make sure you have a Home Office Project License
- apply for a [Research Import Certificate](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ric/Application.aspx) (RIC)

You need a new RIC for each product, substance, or combination of active substances you import.

###SICs and STCs

You can only apply to import veterinary medicines under the SIC or STC if you’re a:

- veterinary surgeon registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS). 
- Home Office Project license holder

[SME question: How do you apply for the Home Office project licence?]

###STCs

You must submit an application for each individual species of animal. An application for a group of animals such as a herd or flock on the same treatment may be submitted as one application.

There's no fee for this certificate.

###SICs

You can make an application for a number of animals regardless of the species.

###Apply for an SIC or STC

You should [apply for your certificate online](https://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/sis/default.aspx).

If the online system isn't working, you can use the relevant application form:

- [SIC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549418/_630643_Application_Form_SIC.docx) (MS Word Document, 44.1KB)
- [STC](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549417/_630628_Application_Form_STC.docx) (MS Word Document, 62.5KB)

There's no fee for this certificate.

###Live vaccines

For information on importing live vaccines under a SIC or STC, contact [importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk)

###New products

If you are applying for a product that has not previously been permitted import into the UK (a new product), in addition to a completed application you will need to provide a copy of the:

- summary of product characteristics (SPC) or equivalent product information (for STC applications) in English
- product labels in the native language

[SME question: if you're importing a new productto supply to a wholesaler, what do you do?]
[SME question: How do people get their Summary of Product Characteristics?]

###Wholesale dealers import certificates (WDIC)

You need a WDIC if you import and hold medicinal products for supply to a SIC or STC holder.

###Apply for a WDIC
{:wholesale-licence}

You need to:

- make sure you have a Home Office licence to supply controlled drugs to the UK.
- complete the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/549415/_630639_Application_Form_WDIC.docx) (MS Word Document, 42.6KB)
- email it to [importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk)

It is free unless more than 100 SICs or STCs naming the wholesale dealer as the importer were supplied in the 12 months before the application. In this case, the fee is £760. 

When a fee applies, it should not accompany the application; an invoice will be sent to you following issue of your certificate.

A WDIC will not be issued for a new product without evidence of a demand for the product.

[SME question: what evidence is required and how is it sent?]
[SME question: is this the correct process?]

###RIC

- make sure you have a home office project licence 
- [register for the special imports scheme](http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ric/Application.aspx)

###Urgent applications

An application is treated as urgent if it is for a product for which the VMD thinks there is an immediate, clinically threatening need.

If you think your individual application is urgent, provide an explanation of the urgency.

You can also email [importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:importcert@vmd.defra.gsi.gov.uk) for help.
