$CTA


What you need to do to move or import live animals depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- within the EU, or from Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland
- outside the EU


## Within the EU

All animals you import from within the EU must accompanied by an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC).

Make sure your exporter includes original health certificates with the consignment, and that they are kept by the person who ordered the consignment.

###Before your consignment arrives

Send written notification of your consignment to the [APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) office closest to the import destination 24 hours before it arrives.

APHA can also advise if your exporter needs to include a commercial document with their consignment.

You must include the:

- name, address and phone number of the destination
- expected date and time of arrival at the destination
- number of animals, their breed, their sex, their passport number (if applicable) or their identification
- name and address of the place the animals came from
- date
- signature of the person responsible for the consignment


The freight forwarder should keep the journey log and animal transport certificate.

### When your consignment arrives

Get your consignment checked by an APHA inspector.

Once checked, animals must be taken directly to the place of destination that you’ve named on the health certificate.

You must rest livestock (except for registered horses) for 48 hours if you intend to move them again.


### Checking animal identification

You must cross-check any containers holding animals that can’t be individually marked (eg bees or day-old chicks) to make sure they’re accounted for on the health certificate.

Sheep and goats must have an electronic identifier - find out more about sheep and goat identification requirements.

Pigs must have either a slapmark, an ear tag, or a tattoo with the herd mark of their holding - find out more about pig identification requirements.

If you’re the operator of the destination site, and it’s an EU-approved market or assembly centre, you must not admit any animal unless it has the right certification and complies with EU regulation.

If there are any errors in the documentation for your incoming consignment, eg unidentified animals, you must:

- contact APHA immediately
- isolate the relevant animal until APHA has authorised its release

[how long can release take to authorise?]


### Importing endangered species

If you’re moving an endangered species into Great Britain from an EU country, you may need to apply for a CITES permit.

Find out about the [species that are on the CITES list](https://www.gov.uk/cites-controls-import-and-export-of-protected-species).

If your animals are on the list:

[complete the form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf)
Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk>

A permit costs £63. You should receive it within 15 working days.


###Animal welfare

You must make sure you meet animal welfare standards when importing live animals.


## Outside the EU

You can only bring live animals or animal products into the EU from countries on the [EU’s approved list](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/trade/third/index_en.htm).


### Check if you need a licence

Check the [list of general licences](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations) that are available. If the general licence or authorisation you need exists, you don’t have to apply, but you must make sure you follow the conditions in the published licence.

Some general licences must travel with the consignment - check your general licence to see if this is the case.

### Specific licences

If the general licence you need doesn’t exist, you must apply for a specific licence for that product using [form IV58](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488485/form-iv58.pdf).

You should return the completed application form to the:

- [APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle](#Contact-APHA) if the entry point is in England
- Scottish or Welsh government if the entry point is in Scotland or Wales

[Scottish, Welsh link needed]
[N.Ireland?]

Some animals, such as rodents, lagomorphs and most exotic mammals, must have a specific licence - complete [form RM01](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/288876/RM01_notice_of_appointment_of_an_administrative_receiver_receiver_or_manager.pdf) for this licence.


### When you need a health certificate

If you’re importing live animals and animal products, you must make sure the exporter you’re working with gets the health certificate required by EU or national law.

You can contact the APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle to find out when you need to do this.


### When you don’t need a licence

The animals below are covered by a general licence. This means you don’t need to apply for one if you import them from the Channel Islands, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or countries outside the EU.

- captive birds (Channel Islands or Northern Ireland)
- pet birds (Northern Ireland)
- cattle
- sheep and goats
- poultry and hatching eggs
- pigs
- non-domestic ungulates


You must follow the conditions in the general licence.

Some general licences must also travel with the consignment - check the licence that applies to the animals you’re importing.

Contact the [APHA](#Contact-APHA) Centre for International Trade Carlisle to find out which legislation applies.

Many animal products must come from establishments that are approved to export into the EU.


### Quarantine controls

[Check the list of animals at risk of rabies](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427913/guid-rm01a.pdf) to see if the animals you’re importing need a licence to comply with rabies regulations.

If your animals is on the list:

- [complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427912/form-rm01.pdf)
- send it to the [International Trade Centre Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)

Complete the form to apply for a licence to import live animals excluding pet dogs, cats and ferrets.

### Consignment checks

### Before your consignment arrives

It’s a legal requirement to tell the Border Inspection Post about your consignment in advance - if you don’t, you may be charged an additional fee or your checks could take longer.


You need to:

- [complete part 1 of the CVED](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/blankcved.pdf)
- return it to the [Border Inspection Post](http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/vet-border-control/bip-contacts/index_en.htm) before the consignment is unloaded


### Find a border inspection post

[Check the border inspection post you’re using is approved](http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/bips_contact_unitedkingdom.pdf) to check the animals or animal products in your shipment.

[If it isn’t, what do you do?]


### When your consignment arrives

When your consignment arrives, port operators may charge you to move it to the Border Inspection Post.

[How much might importers be changed?]

Official veterinarians at the Border Inspection Post will then check animal or animal product identity and documentation.

They may also carry out a physical check.

If your consignment passes the check, officials will give you a completed and validated Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED)
