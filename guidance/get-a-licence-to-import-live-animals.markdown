There are different guides for:

- pets
- livestock, poultry and bees
- horses and ponies
- fish and shellfish

$CTA


What you need to do to move or import live animals depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- within the EU, or from Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Iceland
- outside the EU

Whether you're importing from within the EU or from outside it, you must follow [animal welfare standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/farm-animal-welfare-during-transportation).


## Within the EU


You must send details about your consignment to the [APHA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) closest to the port you're importing to, 24 hours before it arrives.

[can you email this? If so, which email address should you use?]

You must include the:

- name, address and phone number of the destination
- expected date and time of arrival at the destination
- number of animals, their breed, their sex, their passport number (if applicable) or their identification
- name and address of the place the animals came from
- date
- your signature


[SME question: does the importer need to scan their signature? Is it necessary if you're sending the details by email?]
[SME question: how does the inspector know where to go to do the inspection?]


## When your consignment arrives

An inspector will check your consignment at the port or airport.

[How long will this take? How is this instigated?]

You must rest livestock (except for registered horses) for 48 hours if you intend to move them again.

###Identification checks

You must check that any containers holding animals that can’t be individually marked (eg bees or day-old chicks) match animals listed on the health certificate.


If there are any errors in the documentation for your incoming consignment, such as unidentified animals, you must:

- contact APHA immediately
- isolate the relevant animal until APHA has authorised its release

[how long can release take to authorise?]

Sheep and goats must have an electronic identifier - find out more about sheep and goat identification requirements.

Pigs must have either a slapmark, an ear tag, or a tattoo with the herd mark of their holding - find out more about pig identification requirements.


## Outside the EU

You can only bring live animals or animal products into the EU from countries on the [EU’s approved list](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/trade/third/index_en.htm).

### Check if you need a licence

Check the [list of general licences](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations) that are available.

If the general licence or authorisation you need exists, you don’t have to apply, but you must make sure you follow the conditions in the published licence.

Some general licences must travel with the consignment - check your general licence to see if this is the case.

[SME question: How is this arranged? Do you contact the exporter, or does the courier do it?]

### When you don’t need a licence

The animals below are covered by a general licence. This means you don’t need to apply for one if you import them from the Channel Islands, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or countries outside the EU.

- captive birds (Channel Islands or Northern Ireland)
- pet birds (Northern Ireland)
- cattle
- sheep and goats
- poultry and hatching eggs
- pigs
- non-domestic ungulates

### Specific licences

If the general licence you need doesn’t exist, you must apply for a specific licence for that product using [form IV58](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488485/form-iv58.pdf).

You should return the completed application form to the:

- [APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle](#Contact-APHA) if the entry point is in England
- Scottish or Welsh government if the entry point is in Scotland or Wales

[SME question: where should we point those importing to Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland?]

## Quarantine controls

[Check the list of animals at risk of rabies](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427913/guid-rm01a.pdf)

If your animals are on the list you must  get a licence. You need to:

- [complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/427912/form-rm01.pdf)
- send it to the [International Trade Centre Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)


### When you need a health certificate
{:#health-certificate}

If you’re importing live animals you must make sure the exporter you’re working with gets the health certificate required by EU or national law. They can contact the APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle to find out when you need to do this.

[SME question: does the exporter need to include the health certificate with the consignment? What happens if they don’t]

### Consignment checks

Contact [APHA](#Contact-APHA) to find out if your consignment must be checked at a border inspection post (BIP).

If it does, you need to:

- [complete part 1 of the CVED](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/blankcved.pdf)
- return it to the appropriate [Border Inspection Post](http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/bips_contact_unitedkingdom.pdf) before the consignment is unloaded

If you don’t, you may be charged an additional fee or your checks could take longer.

### When your consignment arrives

When your consignment arrives, port operators may charge you to move it to the border inspection post.

[How much might importers be charged? Under which circumstances]

Official veterinarians at the border inspection post will then check animal or animal product identity and documentation.

[SME question: How long does this take?]

If your consignment passes the check, officials will give you a completed and validated Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED).

### Fees

It costs £44 to have your consignment checked.

You must pay an additional fee of £80 to get an inspection done at weekends, or any time outside of 8:30am and 5:00pm on weekdays.

[how do you pay?]

## Endangered species

If you’re importing an endangered species, you may need to apply for a CITES permit before the import takes place.
[Find out if your animals species is on the endangered list].

Find out more about CITES, including the species that are on the CITES list.

[SME question: does the importer need an article 10 certificate?]

### Get a CITES permit

If you need a permit:
- [complete the application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423416/form-fed0172-wd.doc)
- email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk>

A permit costs £63. You should receive it within 15 working days.
