You may be able to delay paying excise duty using ‘duty suspension’. You may be able to delay paying excise duty by storing or moving excise goods without paying duty. This is called ‘duty suspension’.

If the goods were produced outside of the EU, you can only move them in duty suspension once you’ve paid custom duties on them.

##Storing duty suspension goods

You’ll need to store your goods in premises that are approved as an excise warehouse. 

Your excise duty will be suspended whilst goods are in an excise warehouse.

You can store: 

* alcohol products - including beer, wine and spirits
* tobacco products - including cigarettes, cigars and loose tobacco
* energy products - including hydrocarbon oils and biofuels for use as motor or heating fuel

Tobacco products can only be stored in an excise warehouse if they’re for:

* exporting
* sale from an export shop
* supply to embassies within the UK
* use by visiting forces
* use as ships’ or aircraft stores

^You must get permission from HMRC if you want to store duty suspended and duty paid goods in the same premises.^

[Question for SME: how do you get permission from HMRC?]

##Who can use excise warehouses

You need to be approved by HMRC to put goods in an excise warehouse.

###UK-based owners

You’ll need to be approved by HMRC as a registered owner. Complete [form EX60](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-an-owner-of-duty-suspended-goods-held-in-excise-warehouses-ex60). You’ll also need to complete [EX102](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-about-the-partners-excise-102) if your company is a partnership.

You must send an up to date business plan with your application. 

HMRC usually process applications within 45 working days. If your application is successful, you’ll be given a certificate of registration detailing your:

* unique registration reference number
* registration conditions or restrictions 

###Non-UK based owners

If you’re an overseas owner without a fixed UK address, you’ll need to appoint someone approved by HMRC as a duty representative to act on your behalf.

Duty representatives must have a business or live in the UK and can only represent non-UK based owners. Apply on [form EX64](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-a-duty-representative-ex64) if you want to act as a duty representative.

##Moving duty suspension goods

You must record when you move duty supension excise goods within the EU on the [Excise Movement and Control System](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/excise-movement-and-control-system-how-to-register-and-use). You don’t have to do this if your goods are allowed to move under [simplified procedures](LINK).

You must make sure that you’ve either [paid excise duty](LINK) or [deferred payment](LINK) before you move goods from an excise warehouse.
