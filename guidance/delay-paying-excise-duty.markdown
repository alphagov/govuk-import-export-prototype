You may be able to delay paying excise duty using ‘duty suspension’. You may be able to delay paying excise duty by storing or moving excise goods without paying duty. This is called ‘duty suspension’.

If the goods were produced outside of the EU, you can only move them in duty suspension once you’ve paid custom duties on them.

##Storing duty suspension goods

You’ll need to store your goods in premises that are approved as an excise warehouse. 

Your excise duty will be suspended whilst goods are in an excise warehouse.

You can store: 

* alcohol products - including beer, wine and spirits
* tobacco products - including cigarettes, cigars and loose tobacco
* energy products - including hydrocarbon oils and biofuels for use as motor or heating fuel

Tobacco products can only be stored in an excise warehouse if they’re for:

* exporting
* sale from an export shop
* supply to embassies within the UK
* use by visiting forces
* use as ships’ or aircraft stores

^You must get permission from HMRC if you want to store duty suspended and duty paid goods in the same premises.^

[Question for SME: how do you get permission from HMRC?]

##Who can use excise warehouses

You need to be approved by HMRC to put goods in an excise warehouse.

###UK-based owners

You’ll need to be approved by HMRC as a registered owner. Complete [form EX60](/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-an-owner-of-duty-suspended-goods-held-in-excise-warehouses-ex60). You’ll also need to complete [EX102](/government/publications/excise-movements-about-the-partners-excise-102) if your company is a partnership.

You must send an up to date business plan with your application. 

HMRC usually process applications within 45 working days. If your application is successful, you’ll be given a certificate of registration detailing your:

* unique registration reference number
* registration conditions or restrictions 

###Non-UK based owners

If you’re an overseas owner without a fixed UK address, you’ll need to appoint someone approved by HMRC as a duty representative to act on your behalf.

Duty representatives must have a business or live in the UK and can only represent non-UK based owners. Apply on [form EX64](/government/publications/excise-warehousing-application-to-be-a-duty-representative-ex64) if you want to act as a duty representative.

##Moving duty suspension goods and the Excise Movement and Control System

You must make sure that you’ve either [paid excise duty](LINK) or [deferred payment](LINK) before you move goods from an excise warehouse. 

You must record when you move duty suspension excise goods within the EU on the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). You don’t have to do this if your goods are allowed to move under [simplified procedures](LINK).

If you’ve been approved by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to receive or dispatch excise goods in duty suspension, you’ll need to use EMCS if the duty suspended goods are moving:

* between the UK and another EU member state 
* within the UK

Before you can use EMCS you must first [register for HMRC Online Services](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/login?GAREASONCODE=-1&GARESOURCEID=Common&GAURI=https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/home&Reason=-1&APPID=Common&URI=https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/home) and then enrol for EMCS.

You must register and enrol even if you choose to use a [commercial software package](/government/publications/excise-movement-and-control-system-commercial-software-suppliers/excise-movement-and-control-system-software-commercial-suppliers) or in-house designed software to record the movements of duty suspended goods.

###How to enrol

You’ll need to use your [System for the Exchange of Excise Data (SEED) Excise ID number](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/seed/seed_home.jsp?Lang=en) to enrol for EMCS.

When you enrol for EMCS you must enter the authorised person’s Excise ID.

If you’re a warehouse keeper, you should enter your Excise ID beginning ‘GBWK’. You’ll be classed as a warehouse keeper if you operate premises that are approved for the production or storage of excise goods.

If you don’t have a ‘GBWK’ SEED Excise ID, write to the [National Registration Unit](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/alcohol-duties-national-registration-unit) including:

* company name, trading as name and address
* daytime telephone number
* VAT number - if VAT registered
* approval or registration number - this will be on your approval letter or certificate of registration
* details of your approval - eg whether you’re a registered brewer

You should enter your Excise ID beginning ‘GB’ if you’re either a:
 
* registered consignors
* registered consignees
* temporary registered consignees

Once you’ve enrolled for EMCS you’ll be sent an Activation Code. 

If you don’t activate the service within 28 days, you will need to enrol for the service again.

###Users

The first person from your organisation to register with HMRC Online Services will have full access rights to manage the account. This role is an ‘administrator’.

You can add more people as administrators or give them restricted access rights (assistant) through your [Government Gateway account](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/).

##How to use EMCS

Consignors must [create an electronic administrative document (eAD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/382397/guide-to-ead.pdf) in EMCS before moving duty suspended excise goods.

Once the eAD has been validated, you’ll get a unique Administrative Reference Code (ARC) for that movement.

You must provide the person accompanying the goods (eg the driver of the vehicle transporting the goods) with a printed version of the eAD or any other commercial document clearly showing the ARC.

###Submit a report of receipt

You’ll need to access EMCS to get a notification about the expected consignment if you receive duty suspended goods. 

Once the goods arrive, you should check the consignment against the eAD and then submit a report of receipt on EMCS. 

If there is a shortage or surplus in what you receive, record this on the report of receipt at least 5 working days after the goods are received.
