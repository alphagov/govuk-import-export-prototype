What you need to do to export plants, seeds and bulbs depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland and Liechtenstein
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

There are different rules for [timber or wood](#timber).

$CTA

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html). You can also [contact your local plant health inspector](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices).

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#plants-within-EU}

To sell plants, seeds or bulbs within the [EU](/eu-eea) you must check if you need a:

- [plant passport](#plant-passport) (you don’t need one to sell plants directly to the public)
- [supplier document](#supplier-document)

If you don’t need either of these, you don’t need to follow any other special rules to move plants within the EU.

There are different rules if you're moving [endangered](#endangered-plants) or [prohibited](#prohibited-plants) plants.

###Check if you need a plant passport
{:#plant-passport}

Check if your plant is:

- [listed on the passport application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500861/form-phar3.pdf)(PDF, 1.4MB)
- [at risk of xylella fastidiosa](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545225/form-phar3b-appendix.pdf)(PDF, 227 KB)

If it’s on either list, you’ll need to make a plant passport. You need permission before you can do this - either:

* [apply online through eDomero](http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/)
* fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500861/
form-phar3.pdf) and [send it to your local Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices)

The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) will arrange to inspect your plants and where they're grown. The fee is £46.10 for every 15 minutes of the inspector’s time. There’s a minimum fee of £92.19. 

You can make plant passports when you pass your inspection - APHA will explain how to do this.

Permission to make passports lasts a year, but you may need more inspections if your site has a higher risk of disease. If you renew your permission, you have to pay the fee for inspection again.


###Check if you need a supplier document
{:#supplier-document}

You need a supplier document to sell the seeds, roots or any other plant ‘propagation material’ from ornamental plants within the EU.

Contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices) to:

- get permission and instructions to make supplier documents - you don’t need permission of you already make plant passports
- check if you need one if you’re not sure

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

[Check with the plant authority](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/) in the country that you’re exporting to find out if you need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export:

* plants and plant products
* bulbs
* seeds for sowing

Make sure you ask to receive an official document to explain the rules in that country and how to comply - this will help UK inspectors to prepare your export correctly.

[Question for SME: Is there a better list for NPPOs or plant authorities in all countries than the one we've linked to?]

###Apply for a plant health certificate

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

To get a health certificate, your plants must be inspected. 

 [Apply online through eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx)or by filling in the appropriate form for:

* [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    
* [bulbs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515952/form-ko1.pdf) 
* [seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536160/form-phe90.pdf)
* [potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)
* plants from [outside the EU that were temporarily stored, repacked, or split up](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf).

You might also need to fill in a form for:

* [growing season inspections](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515931/form-phe86.pdf) if the importing country tells you to have an inspection carried out on crop that the plants or seeds were taken from..

* [the soil your plants are growing in](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling) - if the country you're exporting to says you need this

[Send the completed form to your local AHPA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).

If you’re a member of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme), you may not need an inspection. [Contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out.

###Fees  

It usually costs a minimum of £130.48 for a site inspection followed by tests.

If the inspection lasts more than 30 minutes, you’ll have to pay £65.24 for every every extra 15 mins.

If your crops have an inspection during growing season or a soil test, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes and a minimum of £99.36.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.

###Reduced fees

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less than £5,000 in the last financial year

##Exporting timber or wood
{:#timber}

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

There are different rules if you’re exporting [wood packaging](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/wood-packaging-requirements.html).

###Within the EU

[Check the list](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-9P2M34) of timber and wood that need a plant passport.

If you need one:

* [register with the Forestry Commission](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#apply) 
* [follow the instructions for issuing a plant passport](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#2 Issuing plant passports)

###Outside the EU

Check what you need to do with the importing country’s [plant protection organisation,](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/)

##Endangered plants
{:#endangered-plants}

Use the Species+ tool to [search for your plant](https://www.speciesplus.net/). Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-the-EU) or [outside the EU](#outside-the-EU).

If Species+ says the plant is banned, you can't export it. 

###Within the EU

If the plant is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must [apply for an Article 10 certificate](#apply-for-an-article-10-certificate) if it’s an artificially propagated plant.

You don’t need any special documents if you’re using plants for non-commercial reasons, eg for scientific research, educational display or giving it away.

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 

Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or [post it to the Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. Find out how to pay for your application.

You should get your certificate within 15 working days.


###Outside the EU

If it's classed as A, B or C, you need a [CITES export permit](#apply-for-a-cites-permit).

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a [CITES export permit](apply-for-a-cites-permit). Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

If you're re-exporting goods include supporting documents to prove it legally entered the EU.

Email or post the completed form to [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)or([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland.

A permit costs £74 (or £59 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

If you're exporting as part of conservation work, you might be able to [get a fee waiver](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/50323/form-citb20.pdf).

###Regular exports for public exhibition

If you regularly take plants abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, [check if you can use a travelling exhibition certificate](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/pdf/referenceguide_en.pdf) instead of a CITES permit. 

You can use the certificate whether you're moving goods within or outside the EU. 

It's valid for 3 years and means you don't need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​

###Apply

- complete the [application](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-travelling-exhibition-certificate)
- send it to the address on the form

You’ll get your certificate within 15 working days and there’s no fee.

##Prohibited plants and soil
{:#prohibited-plants}

How you export prohibited plants and soil depends on whether you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

###Within the EU

You can't usually move:

- [plants listed under Annex III](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:169:0001:0112:EN:PDF#page=38) (424kb, PDF)
- soil from outside Europe, and from Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Turkey or Ukraine

As well as soil from these countries, you also can’t move other organic matter you can grow plants in, excluding:

* peat
* marine sediments
* pure sand, clay, talc, rocks, volcanic pumice or chalk

###Check the importer has scientific licence

You can only send prohibited plants or soil to someone who has a scientific licence to receive them. They will have a 'letter of authority' with their licence.

You must:

* ask the recipient to send you a copy of their 'letter of authority'
* send it to APHA to be endorsed
* attach the letter inside and outside all the packages once it's been endorsed
* store prohibited the plants or soil in 3 layers of packaging - at least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof

If the recipient tells you that you don’t need a letter of authority, ask for their official confirmation of this from their national plant protection organisation. Don't send your material until you’ve got this.

###Outside the EU

[Contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out what you need to do, including what the rules are in the country you're exporting to.
