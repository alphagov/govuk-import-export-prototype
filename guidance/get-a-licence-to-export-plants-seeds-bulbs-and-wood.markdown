You might need a health certificate to prove your plant, seeds, bulbs, wood or related products are free from pests and diseases. 

There are different rules if your plant is endangered or prohibited.

##The normal rules for plants

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#plants-within-EU) or [outside the EU](#plants-outside-EU).

###Within the EU
{:#plants-within-EU}

You don't need to follow special rules for plants unless you either need:

- a plant passport
- a supplier document

###Check if you need a plant passport

Some plants need a plant passport. Check the [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446525/plant-passports-plant-products.pdf)(PDF, 212KB),[seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446527/plant-passports-seed.pdf),[bulbs or corns](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446530/plant-passports-bulbs.pdf) and the [regions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446531/plant-passports-protected-zones.pdf) (PDF, 108KB) where you need one.

Seed potatoes always need a plant passport when moved around the UK or the EU. They must be part of the [Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme).

If you’re exporting to Switzerland, there are different [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447496/plant-passports-switzerland-1.pdf) (PDF, 108KB), [seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447497/plant-passports-switzerland2.pdf), [bulbs or corms](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447498/plant-passports-switzerland3.pdf) and the [regions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447499/plant-passports-switzerland4.pdf) (PDF, 201KB) that need a 
passport.

There are different rules if you're [moving soil or prohibited plants](#exporting-prohibited-plants-and-soil).

$CTA

###Check if you need a supplier document

You need a supplier document if you’re moving the seeds, roots or any other plant ‘propagation material’ from ornamental plants.

You don't need a supplier document if both:

* your goods are for retail sale
* you're a small producer selling to the local market - you must sell your produce within a 50 metres radius of your site and mark it 'for direct sale to the public only'.

If you’re not sure, contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices).

###Get permission to make passports or supplier documents

You need to either:

* complete the [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-passports-application) and [send it to APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate)

* [register for eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx) and do it online

They’ll inspect your plants and you’ll get a unique registration number if you pass.
 
Your permission will last a year but you may need more inspections if your site has a higher risk of diseases.

^You only need to apply to make supplier documents separately if you're not already authorised to issue plant passports.

### Inspection fees

You’ll have to pay £46.10 for every 15 mins that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site.

The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. 

You have to pay these fees again if you renew your application the next year.

You won’t have to pay if APHA only authorises you to make supplier documents.

###Creating a standard passport 

You can make this in different formats.

If you use a label or sticker you have to make one for each plant of the same kind, grown by the same producer and going to the same place. 

You can also create a single delivery note for the whole consignment (including plants which don’t need a passport).

In all cases label them ‘EU Plant Passport’ and include:

* ”‘UK” and “EW” (this is the code for APHA)
*  your unique APHA registration number and an individual serial, week, batch or invoice number
*  the botanical name of the plant or plants 
*  the quantity
*  the letters ‘ZP’ and a protected zone code when you’re moving plants in these places
*  the country of origin of the consignment, if it’s originally come from a non-EU country

### Replacement plant passports

You need replacement passport if you split a consignment of plants which already have a passport, it must include all standard passport details and:

* the letters 'RP' - for replacement passport
* the registration number of the original supplier

[Question for SME: Do we need to add that the original supplier might be them?]

^If you don't want to share supplier details you can put your own code on the passport and record the supplier number in case APHA ask.^

###Creating a supplier document

If you want to create a supplier document you can follow the same process but add:

* “EU Quality”
*  the date you make it 
*  your company name
*  the variety name for ‘rootstocks’ (part of a plant used to grow another) 
*  the designation - if there’s no variety name
* the name of the plant group your goods belong to

If you’re moving a mix of plants that need passports and supplier documents just add “EU Label” to the existing the passport.

###Keeping records

You must keep all plant passports that you issue for 1 year so that APHA can investigate any pest or disease outbreaks.

You don’t have to keep supplier documents, unless part of them forms the plant passport.

###Outside the EU
{:#plants-outside-EU}

Most countries require you to have a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) if you export:

* plants and plant products
* bulbs
* seeds for sowing

Check with the country that you’re exporting to find if you need a certificate.

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

###Applying for a plant health certificate in England and Wales 

You must apply for your plants to be tested by filling in the appropriate form for:

* [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    

* [bulbs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515952/form-ko1.pdf) 

* [seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536160/form-phe90.pdf)

* [”growing season inspections”](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515931/form-phe86.pdf)

* plants from [outside the EU that were stored, repacked, or split up](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf)

You can contact APHA to check whether you need:

- a soil inspection for the plants you're exporting - use the [soil inspection form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling) if you do
- to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export - the USA, New Zealand and other countries require this

[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]

###What type of inspection you need

If you’re exporting seeds for sowing an inspector will have to come to your site to take a sample - your certificate which will be valid for 2 years.

If you’re exporting flower bulbs or plants in a ‘dormant state’ you have to get a inspectation during growing season to check for pests that don’t come up at the time of export - this might be required for other plants.

If you’re already part of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme) you may be able to show your results to get your certificate.

###Fees  

It usually costs £13.87 for the plant health certificate and £65.24 for each 15 minutes of a site inspection.

If the inspectors send your goods to a laboratory for testing it will cost £36.35
The minimum cost of any inspection followed by tests is £130.48

If your crops have an inspection during growing season or soil test, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes and a minimum of £99.36.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.

###Reduced fees

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5,000 in the last financial year

##Exporting timber or wood

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

###Within the EU

If you’re exporting wood  you’ll need to [register with the Forestry Commission](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#apply) and you might also need to apply for a plant certificate.

[Check the list](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-9P2M34) of timber and wood that need a plant certificate - [this process for making one is different](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#2 Issuing plant passports). 

###Outside the EU

Contact the importing country’s National Plant Protection Organisation to [check their plant health regulation](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/).

If you’re exporting wood as packaging for your goods, [there are different rules](link to guide of packaging regulations].

##Exporting endangered plants

The rules on exporting endangered plants are different depending on whether you’re within the EU or outside the EU

###Within the EU

You don’t usually need a permit or licence to move endangered species around the EU unless your plant is listed in [appendix 1](http://www.speciesplus.net/).

These types of plants can’t be used for commercial purposes but there are special circumstances when they can be traded with an internal trade certificate (for example if the plants were bred artificially and passed on to ensure the species survives).

[Check with AHPA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) if you think this could apply to you.

###Outside the EU

You must apply for a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permit before you export endangered animals. 

Check if the plant you want to export is [controlled by CITES.](http://www.speciesplus.net/)

^You can’t export certain species to some countries - check the [CITES trade suspension list](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php).^

###Apply for a CITES permit

Complete form [FED0172](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB).

You must pay a £63 for an export licence and £37 for a re-export licence.

Post your application to [APHA](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html#contacts).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application.


##Exporting prohibited plants and soil

You can't usually export:

- prohibited plants - check the [list of plants](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:169:0001:0112:EN:PDF#page=38) (424kb, PDF) under Annex III
- prohibited soil - this is all soil from outside Europe, and from Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Turkey or Ukraine

Prohibited soil includes other organic matter you can grow plants in, but not:

* peat
* marine sediments
* pure sand, clay, talc, rocks, volcanic pumice or chalk

How you export prohibited plants and soil depends on whether you're exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

###Within the EU

You can only send prohibited plants or soil to someone who has a licence to receive them. They will have a 'letter of authority' with their licence.

You must:

* ask the recipient to send you a copy of their 'letter of authority'
* send it to APHA to be endorsed
* attach the letter inside and outside all the packages once it's been endorsed
* store prohibited the plants or soil in 3 layers of packaging - at least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof

If the recipient tells you that you don’t need a letter of authority, ask for their official confirmation of this from their national plant protection organisation. Don't send your material until you’ve got this.

[Question for SME: Does the inspection only happen for the person who gets a licence (the importer)?]

###Outside the EU

[Contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out what you need to do, including what the rules are in the country you're exporting to.
