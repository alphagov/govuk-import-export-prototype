You might need a health certificate to prove your plant, seeds, bulbs, wood or related products are free from pests and diseases.

##In the EU

You won't need a certificate to move plants plants, seeds, corms, roots or bulbs in most cases.

Certain species will require a plant passport or a supplier document within the UK or the EU.

If you’re moving plants for food, there are different rules[link to food content].

###When you need a plant passport or document

Check if your plants need a passport for:

* all mouvements [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446525/plant-passports-plant-products.pdf)(PDF, 212KB) or [to Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447496/plant-passports-switzerland-1.pdf)(PDF, 108KB)

* protected zones [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446531/plant-passports-protected-zones.pdf)(PDF, 252KB) or [within Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447499/plant-passports-switzerland4.pdf)(PDF, 201KB)

If you’re moving goods to be grown on, you’ll need a passport for certain:

* seeds and planting plants [in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446527/plant-passports-seeds.pdf) or [to Swizerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447497/plant-passports-switzerland2.pdf)

* bulbs or corms [in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446530/plant-passports-bulbs.pdf) or [to Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447498/plant-passports-switzerland3.pdf)

You need a supplier document if you’re moving the seeds, roots or any other plant ‘propagation material’ from ornamental plants.

###When you don't need a supplier document

You don't need a make supplier documents if:

* you goods are for retail sale
* you're a small producer selling to the local market - you must sell your produce within a 50 metres radius of your site and mark it 'for direct sale to the public only'.

You're considered a small producer if:

* you don't trade in plants that are covered by the plant passport scheme
* you have less than 1,000 metres squared of plants overall and less than 100 metres squared is under protection
* the charge for 2 inspections would be more than 10% of your turnover

##Get permission to make passports or supplier documents

You need to either:

* complete the [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-passports-application) and [send it to APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate)

* [register for eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx) and do it online

They’ll inspect your plants and you’ll get a unique registration number if you pass.
 
Your permission will last a year but you may need more inspections if your site has a higher risk of diseases.

^You only need to apply to make supplier documents separately if you're not already authorised to issue plant passports.

### Inspection fees

You’ll have to pay £46.10 for every 15 mins that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site.

The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. 

You have to pay these fees again if you renew your application the next year.

You won’t have to pay if APHA only authorises you to make supplier documents.

###Creating a standard passport 

You can make this in different formats.

If you use a label or sticker you have to make one for each plant of the same kind, grown by the same producer and going to the same place. 

You can also create a single delivery note for the whole consignment (including plants which don’t need a passport).

In all cases label them ‘EU Plant Passport’ and include:

* ”‘UK” and “EW” (this is the code for APHA)
*  your unique APHA registration number and an individual serial, week, batch or invoice number
*  the botanical name of the plant or plants 
*  the quantity
*  the letters ‘ZP’ and a protected zone code when you’re moving plants in these places
*  the country of origin of the consignment, if it’s originally come from a non-EU country

### Replacement plant passports

You need replacement passport if you split a consignment of plants which already have a passport, it must include all standard passport details and:

* the letters 'RP' - for replacement passport
* the registration number of the original supplier

[Question for SME: Do we need to add that the original supplier might be them?]

^If you don't want to share supplier details you can put your own code on the passport and record the supplier number in case AHPA ask.^

###Creating a supplier document

If you want to create a supplier document you can follow the same process but add:

* “EU Quality”
*  the date you make it 
*  your company name
*  the variety name for ‘rootstocks’ (part of a plant used to grow another) 
*  the designation - if there’s no variety name
* the name of the plant group your goods belong to

If you’re moving a mix of plants that need passports and supplier documents just add “EU Label” to the existing the passport.




## Keeping records

You must keep all plant passports that you issue for 1 year so that APHA can investigate any pest or disease outbreaks.

You don’t have to keep supplier documents, unless part of them forms the plant passport.

## Paying APHA to issue plant passports

You can also [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) and pay them to issue plant passports for you.

##Getting a plant passport for timber or wood

If you’re exporting wood  you’ll need to [register with the Forestry Commission](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#apply) and you might also need to apply for a plant certificate.

[Check the list](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-9P2M34) of timber and wood that need a plant certificate - [this process for making one is different](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#2 Issuing plant passports). 

##Outside the EU

##Exporting plants from England or Wales

You’ll need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export:
*plants and plant products
*bulbs
*seeds for sowing

###Getting a plant health certificate in England and Wales 

If you’re exporting seeds for sowing an inspector will have to come to your site to take a sample. If you pass you’ll get a certificate which will be valid for 2 years.

If you’re exporting flower bulbs or plants in a ‘dormant state’ you have to get a ‘growing season inspection’ to check for pests that don’t come up at the time of export - this might be required for other plants.



If you’re already part of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme) you may be able to show your results to get your certificate.

###Apply for inspection

You must fill in a form and send it to [your local AHPA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) for:

*[plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    

*[bulbs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515952/form-ko1.pdf) 

*[seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536160/form-phe90.pdf)

*[”growing season inspections”](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515931/form-phe86.pdf)

* there’s a different [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf) if you’re exporting goods (with a certificate) which came back to England or Wales from a non-EU country and were stored, repacked, or split up

Contact APHA to check if the country you’re exporting to requires you to test the soil that your crops are grown in - you may need to fill in a [soil form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling).  

Ask if you need to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export. The USA, New Zealand and other countries require this.

[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]

###Fees  

It costs £13.87 to get a plant health certificate.

It costs £65.24 for each 15 minutes of a site inspection.

If the inspectors send your goods to a laboratory for testing it will cost £36.35
The minimum cost of any inspection followed by tests is £130.48

If your crops have a ‘growing inspection’ or soil test, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes and a minimum of £99.36.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.

###Reduced fees

You may be entitled to a 50% discount for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if you’re both:

* not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5000 in the last financial year

Fill in this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) to apply.

^You must tell AHPA when you are no longer eligible for this concession
