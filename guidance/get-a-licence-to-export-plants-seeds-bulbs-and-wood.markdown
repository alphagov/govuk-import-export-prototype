What you need to do to export plants, seeds and bulbs depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland and Liechtenstein
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

There are different rules for [timber or wood](#timber).

$CTA

Also [check the import rules](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/) of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [contact your local plant health inspector](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices).

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#plants-within-EU}

To sell plants, seeds or bulbs within the [EU](/eu-eea) you must check if you need a:

- [plant passport](#plant-passport) (you don’t need one to sell plants directly to the public)
- [supplier document](#supplier-document)

If you don’t need either of these, you don’t need to follow any other special rules to move plants within the EU.

There are different rules if you're moving [endangered](#endangered-plants) or [prohibited](#prohibited-plants) plants.

###Check if you need a plant passport
{:#plant-passport}

Check if your plant is:

- [listed on the passport application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500861/form-phar3.pdf)(PDF, 1.4MB)
- [at risk of xylella fastidiosa](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545225/form-phar3b-appendix.pdf)(PDF, 227 KB)

If it’s on either list, you’ll need to make a plant passport. You need permission before you can do this - either:

* [apply online through eDomero](http://edomero.defra.gov.uk/)
* fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/500861/
form-phar3.pdf) and [send it to your local Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices)

The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) will arrange to inspect your plants and where they're grown. The fee is £46.10 for every 15 minutes of the inspector’s time, including travel. There’s a minimum fee of £92.19. 

You can make plant passports when you pass your inspection - APHA will explain how to do this.

Permission to make passports lasts a year, but you may need more inspections if your site has a higher risk of disease. If you renew your permission, you have to pay the fee for inspection again.


###Check if you need a supplier document
{:#supplier-document}

You need a supplier document to sell the seeds, roots or any other plant ‘propagation material’ from ornamental plants within the EU.

Contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices) to:

- get permission and instructions to make supplier documents - you don’t need permission of you already make plant passports
- check if you need one if you’re not sure

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

[Check with the plant authority](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/) in the country that you’re exporting to find if you need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export:

* plants and plant products
* bulbs
* seeds for sowing

Make sure you ask to receive an official document to explain the rules in that country and how to comply - this will help UK inspectors to prepare your export correctly.

[Question for SME: Is there a better list for NPPOs or plant authorities in all countries than the one we've linked to?]

###Apply for a plant health certificate

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

To get a health certificate, your plants must be inspected. 

 [Apply online through eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx)or by filling in the appropriate form for:

* [plants](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    
* [bulbs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515952/form-ko1.pdf) 
* [seeds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536160/form-phe90.pdf)
* [potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)
* plants from [outside the EU that were stored, repacked, or split up](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf).

[Question for SME: Is there a different form for ware potatoes?]

You might also need to fill in a form for:

* [growing season inspections](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515931/form-phe86.pdf) to export flower bulbs, or plants in a ‘dormant state’
* [the soil your plants are growing in](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling) - if the country you're exporting to says you need this

[Send the completed form to your local AHPA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).

If you’re a member of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme), you may not need an inspection. [Contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out.

###Fees  

It usually costs a minimum of £130.48 for a site inspection followed by tests.

If the inspection lasts more than 30 minutes, you’ll have to pay £65.24 for every every extra 15 mins.

If your crops have an inspection during growing season or a soil test, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes and a minimum of £99.36.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.

###Reduced fees

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less than £5,000 in the last financial year

##Exporting timber or wood
{:#timber}

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

###Within the EU

If you’re exporting wood  you’ll need to [register with the Forestry Commission](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#apply) and you might also need to apply for permission to make plant passports.

[Check the list](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-9P2M34) of timber and wood that need a plant passoirt. If you need one, apply for permission and follow the instructions for [making a plant passport](http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-9nrkps#2 Issuing plant passports). 

###Outside the EU

Check what you need to do with the importing country’s [plant protection organisation](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/).

There are different rules if you’re exporting [wood packaging](http://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/wood-packaging-requirements.html).

##Endangered plants
{:#endangered-plants}

[Search for the plant you’re exporting](http://www.speciesplus.net/). It’s endangered if it’s listed as ‘appendix 1’.

Within the EU, you usually can’t move endangered plants except in special cases (like for conservation necessary for the species to survive). [Check with APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out.

Outside the EU, you need to:

- check the [list of banned exports](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php) - some plants to certain countries are banned outright
- [apply for a CITES permit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB), if the plant isn’t banned

Send the permit application form by post or email to [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application. You must pay a £63 for an export licence and £37 for a re-export licence.


##Prohibited plants and soil
{:#prohibited-plants}

How you export prohibited plants and soil depends on whether you’re exporting within the EU or outside the EU.

###Within the EU

You can't usually move:

- [plants listed under Annex III](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:169:0001:0112:EN:PDF#page=38) (424kb, PDF)
- soil from outside Europe, and from Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Turkey or Ukraine

As well as soil from these countries, you also can’t move other organic matter you can grow plants in, excluding:

* peat
* marine sediments
* pure sand, clay, talc, rocks, volcanic pumice or chalk

###Check the importer has scientific licence

You can only send prohibited plants or soil to someone who has a scientific licence to receive them. They will have a 'letter of authority' with their licence.

You must:

* ask the recipient to send you a copy of their 'letter of authority'
* send it to APHA to be endorsed
* attach the letter inside and outside all the packages once it's been endorsed
* store prohibited the plants or soil in 3 layers of packaging - at least 1 of the layers must be escape and shatter-proof

If the recipient tells you that you don’t need a letter of authority, ask for their official confirmation of this from their national plant protection organisation. Don't send your material until you’ve got this.

###Outside the EU

[Contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out what you need to do, including what the rules are in the country you're exporting to.
