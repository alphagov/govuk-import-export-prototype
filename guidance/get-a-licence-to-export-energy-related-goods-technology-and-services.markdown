It’s a criminal offence to export certain equipment used to drill for oil or gas to Russia without a licence.

Check the list of [goods and services](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02014R0833-20151009) covered by EU sanctions that need a licence.

Also check Russia's import rules. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

- oil exploration or production in waters deeper than 150 metres
- oil exploration or production in the offshore area north of the Arctic Circle
- shale fracking

Examples of services include:

* drilling

##Apply for an export licence

$CTA

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

$CTA 

Applications take around 20 working days, but can take longer if the Export Control Organisation (ECO) needs to check your application with the government of the country you’re exporting to.

There's no fee for a licence.

##Providing financial assistance to traders

You’ll need a separate financial assistance licence if you or your company provide financial assistance related to oil or gas services.

This includes any type of advice or role in a financial transaction which would help banned or restricted trade (for example, processing a payment)

Contact ECO to ask for the application form.

##Providing technical assistance

You’ll need a separate technical assistance licence if you or your company provide technical service related to oil or gas. 

This could means:

* repairs and maintenance
* manufacture and assembly
* any technical advice or consulting

Contact ECO to ask for the application form.

##Your license responsibilities

You’re responsible for making sure that your licence is still valid when you export goods, technologies and services.
