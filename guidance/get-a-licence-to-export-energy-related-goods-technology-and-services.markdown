##Goods and services you can’t export
There’s a complete ban on exporting energy related goods, technologies or services for use in:

- oil exploration or production in waters deeper than 150 metres in the offshore area north of the Arctic Circle
- shale fracking

You can still apply for a licence if you agreed to provide the following services before 1 August 2014:

- drilling  
- well testing
- logging and completion services
