What you need to do to export live fish or shellfish depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or read the appropriate [country guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides), which includes contact details for local advice.

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

If the country you’re exporting to requires you to have a health certificate, you must get an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC).

###Apply for an ITAHC
{:#animal-health-certificate}

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email [ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk].
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) if you’ve not used it before.
s3. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.
s5. Your certificate will be sent to your official veterinarian once your animals have passed inspection. If your official veterinarian doesn't receive the certificate, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).
s6. Include the certificate when you export your consignment.

Instead of using TRACES you can:

- fill in [form EXP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530280/exp1.pdf) (PDF, 166KB) and the details obtained from the importing authorities
- email or post it to the address on the form at least 5 working days before you send your goods

You will receive your certificate within 1 week of your application.

There's no fee for the certificate.

- fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530280/exp1.pdf) form at least 5 working days before you export. Email or post it to the address on the form.

If you’re exporting to Norway, you may also need a [UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate).

##Outside the EU

To export live fish and shellfish outside the EU, you must:

- check with the destination country's [embassy](http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies) that the fish or shellfish meets their requirements
- [apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)](#export-health-certificate)
- [check if you need a UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate)

###Apply for an EHC
{:#export-health-certificate}

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you're exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet, or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](http://www.gov.uk/local-council). 
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

There's no fee for the certificate.

###Check if you need a UK catch certificate
{:#catch-certificate}

You need a UK catch certificate for marine caught fish for human consumption to export fish to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine
- any other non-EU country if you’ll re-import the fish back to the EU

You don’t need a catch certificate to export:

- farmed fish and shellfish, or freshwater fish
- mussels, cockles, oysters and scallops
- fish fry or larvae


###How to apply

Fill in a [UK catch certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311517/uk-catch-certificate.pdf) (PDF, 95KB).

Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@mfa.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish came from more than one UK vessel, also fill in a [multiple vessel schedule](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/459218/Multiple_vessel_schedule_template.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 524KB). Submit it with the catch certificate application form.

^If you’re exporting live fish from Scotland, contact [Marine Scotland](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/contact) to get the certificate.^
