What you need to do to export live fish or shellfish depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

You may need health certificate to move live fish and shellfish within the [EU](/eu-eea).

Check if the species carries, or is at risk of, [notifiable diseases](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-serious-fish-or-shellfish-diseases#notifiable-fish-and-shellfish-diseases). If it is, you’ll need a certificate. 

[Question for fact check: what is meant by ‘at risk of’ disease? Does this mean you need a certificate to export any species listed as susceptible in this document? https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317259/Notifiable_fish_diseases.pdf If so, there are over 100 species susceptible to EUS - how would you know if they needed a certificate if your species wasn't listed?]

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530280/exp1.pdf) form at least 5 working days before you export. Send it by email or post to the address on the form.

The health certificate is free.

If you’re exporting to Norway, you may also need a [UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate).
##Outside the EU

To export live fish and shellfish outside the EU, you must:

- check with the destination country's [embassy](/government/world/embassies) that the fish you're exporting meets their requirements
- [apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)](#export-health-certificate)
- [check if you need a UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate)
