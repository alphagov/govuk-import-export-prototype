What you need to do to export live fish or shellfish depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

$CTA

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

$CTA

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

Outside the EU, check with the fish authority in country you’re exporting to. They'll tell you if you need an export health certificate or a TRACES notification.

Ask for a written statement which includes all their requirements and the disease status in that country.

You'll need to fill in an export notification and attach the information you receive from the importing country about their rules.

###Apply for an export notification

Apply for a export notification 5 working days before you are due to export.

The form you need to fill in depends on if you're exporting from:

- [England or Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530280/exp1.pdf) (PDF, 166KB)
- [Scotland](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0048/00484726.doc) (Word, 2MB)
- [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/daera/notification-of-proposed-fish-movement.doc)(Word, 35KB)

Send the completed application to the contact address on your form with supporting documents from the importing country.

If you need an export health certificate, your goods will be inspected and you'll be given a certificate when you pass.

Attach this to your consignment.

If you’re exporting to Norway, you may also need a [UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate).

$CTA

##Outside the EU

To export live fish and shellfish outside the EU, you must:

- check with the destination country's [embassy](http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies) that the fish or shellfish meets their requirements
- [apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)](#export-health-certificate)
- [check if you need a UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate)

###Apply for an EHC
{:#export-health-certificate}

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country. 
s3. If required, they'll ask for the name of the local authority officer who looks after food law enforcement at your premises.
s4. Or, they'll ask you to nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk.
s5. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s6. Your EHC will be sent to your local authority within 7 working days.
s7. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). 
s8. Your local authority inspector will be asked to check that your animal products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.


There's no fee for the certificate but you'll be charged for your vet or local authority officer's time.

###Check if you need a UK catch certificate
{:#catch-certificate}

You need a UK catch certificate for marine caught fish for human consumption to export fish to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine
- any other non-EU country if you’ll re-import the fish back to the EU

You don’t need a catch certificate to export:

- farmed fish and shellfish, or freshwater fish
- mussels, cockles, oysters and scallops
- fish fry or larvae

###How to apply

Fill in a [UK catch certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311517/uk-catch-certificate.pdf) (PDF, 95KB).

Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@mfa.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish came from more than one UK vessel, also fill in a [multiple vessel schedule](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/459218/Multiple_vessel_schedule_template.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 524KB). Submit it with the catch certificate application form.

##Endangered fish and shellfish

Use the Species+ tool to [search for your fish or shellfish](https://www.speciesplus.net/). Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu-endangered) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu-endangered).

If Species+ says the fish or shellfish is banned, you can't export the product. 

###Within the EU
{:#within-eu-endangered}

If the fish or shellfish is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate.

You don’t need any special documents if you’re using or displaying goods for non-commercial reasons, eg for scientific research or in an educational display.

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-commercial-use) for the Article 10 certificate. 

Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or [post it to the Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. 

You should get your certificate within 15 working days.


###Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu-endangered}

If it's classed as A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit.

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a CITES export permit. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB) for a CITES permit

If you're re-exporting goods include a CITES import permit to prove it legally entered the EU.

Email or post the completed form to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

If you’re exporting as part of conservation work, you might be able to [get a fee waiver](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/50323/form-citb20.pdf).

###Regular exports for public exhibition

If you regularly take fish or shellfish abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, [check if you can use a travelling exhibition certificate](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cites/pdf/referenceguide_en.pdf) instead of a CITES permit. You can use the certificate whether you're moving goods within or outside the EU.

You can add multiple specimen types in one application if needed.

It’s valid for 3 years and means you don't need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​

###Apply

- complete the [application](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/endangered-species-application-for-travelling-exhibition-certificate)
- send it to the address on the form or email it to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc)

You’ll get your certificate within 15 working days and there’s no fee.
