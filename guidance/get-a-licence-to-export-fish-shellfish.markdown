You need a health certificate to export fish and shellfish (molluscs and crustaceans) within the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) if the species are:

- at risk of EU controlled diseases
- carriers of EU controlled diseases

###Get a health certificate

Complete the [Notification to export fish to the EU](/government/publications/notification-to-export-live-fish-and-shellfish-form-exp1) form and send it to the [Fish Health Inspectorate](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-fish-shellfish.html#contacts) (FHI).

This is free, but you need to give 5 working days’ notice.

##Exporting live fish outside the EU

You must check with the destination country's [embassy](/government/world/embassies) that the fish you're exporting meets their requirements.

###Get a UK catch certificate

You need a UK catch certificate for marine caught fish for human consumption if you're exporting fish to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine

You'll also need a UK catch certificate to export fish caught by a UK fishing vessel to a non-EU country (for example, for processing) and then re-import them back to the EU.

###How to apply

Complete a [UK catch certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311517/uk-catch-certificate.pdf) (PDF, 95.1KB, 3 pages).

Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@mfa.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish has been sourced from more than one UK vessel then you need to fill in a [Multiple vessel schedule](https://www.gov.uk.government.uploads.system.uploads.attachment_data.file.459218.Multiple_vessel_schedule_template.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 524KB) and submit it alongside the catch certificate as an annex.

###When you don’t need a catch certificate

You don’t need a UK catch certificate to export:

- fish to another EU country
- outside the EU if the fish won’t be re-imported
- farmed fish and shellfish
- freshwater fish
- some molluscs - including mussels, cockles, oysters, and scallops
- fish fry or larvae

^If you’re exporting live fish from Scotland, contact [Marine Scotland](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/contact) to get the certificate.^
