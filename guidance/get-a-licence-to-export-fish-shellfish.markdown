What you need to do to export live fish or shellfish depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu) 

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

Check with the fish authority in the destination country to find out if you need an export health certificate.

If you do:

- ask them for an official document that explains the rules and how to comply
- apply for the certificate by making an export notification at least 5 working days before you export

The application form you fill in depends on whether you're exporting from:

- England or Wales - [InlineAttachment:1]
- [InlineAttachment:15]
- [InlineAttachment:16]
Send the completed application to the address on the form. 

You'll get a certificate when your application is approved. Your goods may need to be inspected first, if the destination country requires this.

Attach the certificate and the official document from the overseas fish authority to your consignment.

If you’re exporting to Norway, you may also need a [UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate).

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

If you're exporting fish or shellfish to be used as food:

- [check if you need a Export Health Certificate](#ehc) (EHC)
- [check if you need a UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate)

Otherwise, check with the fish authority in the destination country to find out what documentation you need. Your [local fish inspectorate](#contacts) can help you get the right documents.

###Check if you need an EHC
{:#ehc}

You'll usually need an EHC if you're exporting food. But depending on the country and your goods, there are some cases where you:

- can't export your fish or shellfish
- don't need a certificate

Contact the [APHA Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to check.

If you need an EHC, follow the steps.

s1. Tell the Centre for International Trade Carlisle what you’re exporting and the destination country.
s2.  If your goods won’t be used as food, you’ll may be ask to nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk> (or contact [DAERA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You'll be given the application form you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your local authority or official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Arrange for your goods to be inspected by your local authority or official veterinarian. They’ll check the goods meet the requirements of the EHC.

There's no fee for the certificate but you'll be charged for your vet or local authority's time.

###Check if you need a UK catch certificate
{:#catch-certificate}

You need a UK catch certificate to export marine caught fish for human consumption to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine
- any other non-EU country if you’ll re-import the fish back to the EU

You don’t need a catch certificate to export:

- farmed fish and shellfish, or freshwater fish
- mussels, cockles, oysters and scallops
- fish fry or larvae

###How to apply

Fill in a [InlineAttachment:2]
Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@marinemanagement.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish came from more than one UK vessel, also fill in a [InlineAttachment:3]. Submit it with the catch certificate application form.

##Endangered fish and shellfish

Use the Species+ tool to [search for your fish or shellfish.](https://www.speciesplus.net/) Check which annex (A, B, C or D) it's classified as under EU wildlife trade regulations.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu-endangered) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu-endangered).

If Species+ says the fish or shellfish is banned, you can't export the product. 

###Within the EU
{:#within-eu-endangered}

If the fish or shellfish is classed as B, C or D, you don't need to do anything.

If it’s classed as Annex A, you must apply for an Article 10 certificate.

You don’t need any special documents if you’re using or displaying goods for non-commercial reasons, for example scientific research or in an educational display.

###Apply for an Article 10 certificate

Fill in either:

* [InlineAttachment:4]
* [InlineAttachment:5]

You can use the [InlineAttachment:6] to help you.

Email it to <wildlife.licensing@apha.gsi.gov.uk> or post it to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Include any supporting documents that show you acquired the product legally, for example:

- a copy of the import permit
- a previous Article 10 certificate (use the yellow copy)

The certificate costs £31. 

You should get your certificate within 15 working days.

###Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu-endangered}

If it's classed as A, B or C, you need a CITES export permit.

If it's classed as D, check the animal's CITES listing in the Species+ tool. If it's in Appendix III, you'll need a CITES export permit. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.

###Apply for a CITES permit

Fill in either:

*  [InlineAttachment:12]
*  [InlineAttachment:11]

Use the [InlineAttachment:10] if you need help.

If you're re-exporting goods include a CITES import permit to prove it legally entered the EU.

Email or post the completed form to the [Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

A permit costs £63 (or £37 to re-export). You should receive it within 15 working days.

If you’re exporting as part of conservation work, you might be able to get a fee waiver through:

* [InlineAttachment:7]
* [InlineAttachment:8]

You can use the [InlineAttachment:9] if you’re unsure how to fill it in.

###Regular exports for public exhibition

If you regularly take fish or shellfish abroad for a short period of time for public exhibitions, [InlineAttachment:13]   instead of a CITES permit. You'll also need to follow the usual rules for exporting fish.

You can use the certificate whether you're moving goods within or outside the EU.

You can add multiple specimen types in one application if needed.

It’s valid for 3 years and means you don't need to apply for permission each time you take your display items abroad.​

To apply, fill in [InlineAttachment:14].

Post or email the completed to the [APHA Centre for International Trade Bristol](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

You’ll get your certificate within 15 working days and there’s no fee.
