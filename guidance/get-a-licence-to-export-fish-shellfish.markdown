What you need to do to export live fish or shellfish depends on whether you’re exporting them:

- [within the EU](#within-eu) or to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland
- [outside the EU](#outside-eu)

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or read the appropriate [country guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides), which includes contact details for local advice.

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

If the country you’re exporting to requires a health certificate and/or a TRACES notification, you'll need to fill in an export notification form.

###Apply for a health certificate

The form you need to fill in depends on if you're exporting from:

- [England or Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/530280/exp1.pdf) (PDF, 166KB)
- [Scotland](www.gov.scot/Resource/0048/00484726.doc) (Word, 2MB)
- [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/daera/notification-of-proposed-fish-movement.doc)(Word, 35KB)

Send the completed application to the contact address on your form.

If you’re exporting to Norway, you may also need a [UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate).

##Outside the EU

To export live fish and shellfish outside the EU, you must:

- check with the destination country's [embassy](http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies) that the fish or shellfish meets their requirements
- [apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)](#export-health-certificate)
- [check if you need a UK catch certificate](#catch-certificate)

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
