You need a health certificate to export fish and shellfish (molluscs and crustaceans) within the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) if the species are:

- at risk of EU controlled diseases
- carriers of EU controlled diseases

###Get a health certificate

Complete the [Notification to export fish to the EU](/government/publications/notification-to-export-live-fish-and-shellfish-form-exp1) form and send it to the [Fish Health Inspectorate](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-fish-shellfish.html#contacts) (FHI).

This is free, but you need to give 5 working days’ notice.

##Exporting live fish outside the EU

You must check with the destination country's [embassy](/government/world/embassies) that the fish you're exporting meets their requirements. 

###Get a UK catch certificate

You need a UK catch certificate for marine caught fish for human consumption if you're exporting fish to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine

You'll also need a UK catch certificate to export fish caught by a UK fishing vessel to a non-EU country (for example, for processing) and then re-import them back to the EU.

###How to apply

Complete a [UK catch certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311517/uk-catch-certificate.pdf) (PDF, 95.1KB, 3 pages).

Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@mfa.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish has been sourced from more than one UK vessel then you need to fill in a [Multiple vessel schedule](https://www.gov.uk.government.uploads.system.uploads.attachment_data.file.459218.Multiple_vessel_schedule_template.xls) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 524KB) and submi alongside the catch certificate as an annex.

###When you don’t need a catch certificate

You don’t need a UK catch certificate to export:

- fish to another EU country
- outside the EU if the fish won’t be re-imported
- farmed fish and shellfish
- freshwater fish
- some molluscs - including mussels, cockles, oysters, and scallops
- fish fry or larvae

^If you’re exporting live fish from Scotland, contact [Marine Scotland](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marine/contact) to get the certificate.^


###Get an Export Health Certificate

You must get an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export fish and shellfish outside the EU. You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of authorities in the destination country, and any other requirements they may have.

####Get an existing EHC issued

There will usually already be an EHC for the type of fish or shellfish you’re exporting and where you’re exporting it to.

Check the [List of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB) to see if the EHC you need already exists and is available for issue.

If the certificate you want already exists, and is available for issue, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) and ask them to send you an application form and a copy of the EHC.

You must complete the application form and the EHC as fully as you can and send it back to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).

####Nominate an official veterinarian

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

To find an OV, you can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team at <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

####Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

####Create a new EHC

In some cases, there won’t be an available EHC that covers the type of consignment you want to send and the destination you’re sending it to.

This could be because:

- the EHC you want is on hold - eg due to a trade ban enforced by the destination country
- there hasn’t been any previous demand for an EHC for the animal you’re exporting to the destination country
- negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing - agreeing new EHCs can take years or stall due to trade barriers

If the EHC you want doesn’t exist, you should talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

You should send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) who will pass the details to Defra for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.
