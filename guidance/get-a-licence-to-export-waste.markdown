You need special permission to export waste inside and outside the EU.

[Use the tool](http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/waste-import-export/124357.aspx) to find out which controls apply to you or if the waste you’re exporting is prohibited.
 
##Get permission to export waste

If the waste you want to export isn't prohibited, you need to create a contract between you and the business you're sending waste to before you apply for controls.

Once you've got one, you need to either:

* complete the form in the [waste export control tool](http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/waste-import-export/124357.aspx) if your waste requires Article 18 controls 
* come back to this page if you need a notification control

##Apply for a notification control

s1. Register for [International Waste Shipments (IWS)](https://international-waste-shipments.service.gov.uk/registration/applicant-registration) and start your application.
s2. Download and complete the financial guarantee (this must be accepted by the importer before you ship the waste).
s3. Complete and upload a [movement document](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/shipments/pdf/correspondents_guidelines3_en.pdf)for each shipment (keep a copy of these).
s4. If your waste is going to another location to be stored or processed before it arrives at its final destination, [attach a completed an interim operation form](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/shipments/pdf/correspondents_guidelines3_en.pdf).
s5. Make sure a copy of the notification control and all supporting documents travels with your goods.

[Question for SME: Can the movement document and the interim form be found within the online service?]

You may need to get insurance before you submit your application as the importing country may ask to see it.

If you haven't heard back from the EA within 30 days of submitting your application, email askshipments@environment-agency.gov.uk.

###How long it lasts

You’ll have 1 year to ship your goods before your ‘notification control’ expires unless the site you're exporting to has pre-consent status. If they do, your control could last up to 3 years.

###Fees

You must pay a fee for this service.

The minimum fee for a ‘recovery’ shipment is £1,450 (for example if you’re recycling the waste) and maximum cost is £14,380 for over 500 shipments.

The minimum cost for disposal of one shipment is £1,540 and the maximum cost is £19,500 for 500.

You'll pay a minimum of £1,700 and maximumof £24,000 if your journey has an ‘interim’ stop.

[Question for SME: Will they be sent an invoice?]

You can apply for a refund from the Environment Agency if you:

* don't send the goods within 12 months
* if your notification control is rejected 
* if you withdraw it before you get an answer

###Increase the number of waste shipments

If you’d like to increase your exports without applying for a new control:

* send the written request to the Environment Agency before any extra shipments take place
* get written consent for your extra shipments from the importing country’s competent authorities’ (these are listed in your notification control application)
* not exceed the maximum tonnage detailed in your notification document

Send your request to:


International Waste Shipments Team    
Environment Agency   
Richard Fairclough House   
Knutsford Road    
Warrington   
WA4 1HT
