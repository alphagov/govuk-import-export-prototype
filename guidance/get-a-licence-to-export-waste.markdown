You need special permission to export waste inside and outside the EU.

[Use the tool](http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/waste-import-export/124357.aspx) to find out which controls apply to you or if the waste you’re exporting is prohibited.
 
##Get permission to export waste

s1. Create a contract between you and the business you're sending waste to
s2. Complete the form in the tool if your waste requires green list controls (Article 18 controls) or come back to this page if you need a notification control. 

If you need a notification control you may also need to get insurance before you submit your application as the importing country may ask to see it.

###Register online to apply for a notification control

$CTA

Once this is ready, register for [International Waste Shipments (IWS)](https://international-waste-shipments.service.gov.uk/registration/applicant-registration) and complete your application (including a financial guarantee before shipping).

$CTA

If your waste is going to another location to be stored or processed before it arrives at its final destination, [fill in this ‘interim operation’ form](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/shipments/pdf/correspondents_guidelines3_en.pdf) and attach it.

[Question for SME: How do they attach the form to their application?]

If you haven't heard back from the EA within 30 days of submitting your application, email askshipments@environment-agency.gov.uk.

You’ll have 1 year to ship your goods before your ‘notification control’ expires.

[Question for SME: Does pre-consent only apply to imports? It says 'receive in the guidance.]

###Fees

You will have to pay a fee for this service.

The minimum fee for a ‘recovery’ shipment is £1,450 (for example if you’re recycling the waste)  
and maximum cost is £14,380 for more than 500 shipments.

If you’re disposing of the waste the minimum cost for one shipment is £1,540 and the maximum cost is £19,500 for 500 shipments.

You will have to pay more if your journey includes an ‘interim’ stop, I'll cost a minimum of £1,700 and a maximum of £24,000 for 500 shipments

[Question for SME: Will they be sent an invoice?]

###Increase the number of waste shipments

If you’d like to increase your exports without applying for a new control:

* send the written request to the Environment Agency before any extra shipments take place
* get written consent for your extra shipments from the importing country’s competent authorities’ (these are listed in your notification control application)
* not exceed the maximum tonnage detailed in your notification document

###Contact the Environment Agency
