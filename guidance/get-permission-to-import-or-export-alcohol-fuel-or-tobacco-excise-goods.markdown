Excise goods are goods you have to pay [alcohol excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/alcohol-duties), [fuel excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/fuel-duty) or [tobacco excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/tobacco-products-duty) on.


You must be registered with HMRC to produce excise goods or to handle excise goods before the excise duty has been paid (called being in ‘duty suspension’).


If you’re registered with HMRC to dispatch excise goods, you can:


- export the goods outside the UK without paying UK excise duty (in some circumstances)
- export goods outside of the UK  after UK excise duty has been paid - then claim back the UK excise duty through excise duty drawback
- sell goods directly to consumers inside and outside the EU


If you're a business buying excise goods produced by someone else and the UK excise duty has already been paid, you can:


- move goods out of the UK to another EU country
- export goods overseas after UK excise duty has been paid - then claim back the UK excise duty through excise duty drawback
- sell goods directly to overseas consumers


There's a [ban on exporting high quality wines, spirits, cigars and cigarillos to North Korea or Syria](/guidance/exporting-luxury-goods-north-korea.html).


### Scotch whisky


You can only export single grain, blended malt, blended grain or blended Scotch whisky outside Scotland if the whisky is:


- bottled and labelled for retail sale, or
- going to someone who is registered with HMRC as a blender, bottler, labeller or approved bulk importer


You must not export Scotch whisky in a wooden cask or holder.


If you need to prove the authenticity of your whisky, contact <certificates.sdvs@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk> to apply for a certificate of age and origin.


### Irish whiskey and poteen (potin)


You must not export Irish whiskey or poteen in a wooden cask or holder.


## If you need a certificate of free sale to export alcohol outside the EU

Some countries require a 'certificate of free sale' before they will let food and drink products into the country.

Check whether you need a certificate by asking the food authority in the importing country. They'll tell you what type they require.

If you need a certificate:

- fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484867/COFSApplicationExportNonEU_v2.0.doc) (MS Word Document, 127KB)
- send it to <trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk>
 
The certificate will usually be issued within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit).

## Moving duty suspended goods within the EU

You can move duty suspended excise goods to someone based in the EU if the goods are being sent:

- from one authorised tax warehouse to another
- to a port or airport, from where they will leave the EU
- from a tax warehouse to someone approved to receive duty suspended goods from the EU("Registered Consignees" and "Temporary Registered Consignees")
- from a tax warehouse to an "exempt consignee" (for example if the trade is for diplomatic reasons or for the army and they have an exemption certificate)

[Question for SME: What's an example of an exempt consignee?]

If you follow the right processes, the excise duty isn’t payable until the goods are released for consumption.

###How to move duty suspended goods within the EU

You can only move goods under excise duty suspension if any import duty or import VAT due has been paid.

You must use the [Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/excise-movement-and-control-system-how-to-register-and-use) to report that you’re moving excise goods in duty suspension.

## Exporting duty paid goods overseas

So that excise duty isn't paid twice, you can claim excise duty drawback on the UK excise duty that’s already been paid.

To claim excise duty drawback, you must be classed as a ‘revenue trader’ by HMRC - a business that’s involved in producing or selling excise goods. 

## Selling goods directly to consumers outside the UK

Most countries have conditions for sellers of excise goods, and most require duty guarantees before you send any goods (including within the EU for duty suspended goods). [Research the legal and tax rules](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html) before you send any goods overseas.

###Selling goods directly to consumers in EU countries ("distance selling")

Some EU countries charge excise duty on excise goods. As the seller, you’re responsible for paying the duty.

EU countries may tell you to appoint a tax representative in their country to guarantee and pay the duty on your behalf.

When you sell duty-paid goods  to a consumer in another EU country, you can claim the UK excise duty back through excise duty drawback.

## How to claim excise duty drawback

You can claim excise duty drawback if you've released the goods within 3 years of the original duty payment.

The minimum amount you can claim is £500. If your claim is for less than £500, wait until you have other claims worth £500 in total, then send them together.

If you don’t make an excise duty drawback claim for 6 months, the minimum claim drops to £50.

s1. Before you send the goods, [notify HMRC online](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/forms/form/notice-of-intention-to-claim-drawback/new) that you’re going to make a claim for excise duty drawback. Or complete [form EX75](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374377/ex75.pdf) (PDF, 214KB) - sometimes called the ‘Notice of Intention’ or ‘NOI’ - and fax, email or post it.
s2. Wait for at least 2 full business days in case HMRC decides to inspect the goods. For example, if HMRC receives your notification on the Monday, you can send the goods on the Thursday. If HMRC receives the notification after 4pm, it counts as the following business day.

If your claim is successful, HMRC will pay the money into your bank account.
