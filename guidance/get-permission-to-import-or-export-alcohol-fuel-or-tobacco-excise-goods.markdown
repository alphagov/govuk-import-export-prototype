## Export alcohol, tobacco or fuel (‘excise goods’)

Excise goods are goods you have to pay [alcohol excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/alcohol-duties), [fuel excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/fuel-duty) or [tobacco excise duty](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/topic/business-tax/tobacco-products-duty) on.

## Exporting excise goods: your options

You must be registered with HMRC to produce excise goods or to handle excise goods before the excise duty has been paid (called being in ‘duty suspension’).

If you’re registered with HMRC to produce excise goods, you can:

- export the goods outside the EU without paying UK excise duty, and instead pay the excise duty in the country the goods are being imported to
- move goods within the EU while they’re in duty suspension
- move goods overseas after UK excise duty has been paid - then claim back the UK excise duty through excise duty drawback
- sell goods directly to overseas consumers

If you buy excise goods produced by someone else, the UK excise duty will already have been paid. You can:

- export goods outside the EU
- move goods overseas after UK excise duty has been paid - then claim back the UK excise duty through excise duty drawback
- sell goods directly to overseas consumers

### Scotch whisky

You can only export single grain, blended malt, blended grain or blended Scotch whisky outside Scotland if the whisky is:

- bottled and labelled for retail sale, or
- going to someone who is registered with HMRC as a blender, bottler, labeller or approved bulk importer

You must not export Scotch whisky in a wooden cask or holder.

### Irish whiskey and poteen (potin)

You must not export Irish whiskey or poteen in a wooden cask or holder.

## Moving duty suspended goods within the EU

You can sell duty suspended excise goods to someone based outside the UK if they:

- are approved as a [‘registered owner’ of excise goods](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receiving-storing-and-moving-excise-goods) in the UK or another EU country
- have a ‘duty representative’ registered with HMRC acting for them

[Question for SME: do we need to mention non-revenue traders here - and if so, what is the non-revenue traders exclusion designed to achieve? Is it aimed to exclude people who are part of the supply chain, but aren’t directly involved in selling excise goods?]

If you sell them to anyone else, excise duty becomes payable immediately.

If you follow the right processes, the excise duty isn’t payable until the goods are released for sale. And the importer is responsible for paying the excise duty.

### How to move duty suspended goods within the EU

You can only move goods under excise duty suspension if they’re in ‘free circulation’. Being in free circulation means that any import duty or import VAT due has been paid.

Usually, you must use the [Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/excise-movement-and-control-system-how-to-register-and-use) to report that you’re moving excise goods in duty suspension.

If the freight forwarder or agent you’re using to move the goods is registered with HMRC for the [Entry in the Declarants Records (EIDR) scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-of-the-union-customs-code-ucc), you can pass the goods to them without making a report through EMCS. Ask your freight forwarder or agent if they are registered for EIDR.

## Moving duty paid goods overseas

If you send excise goods to another country, that country will usually apply excise duty to the goods.

So that you don’t pay excise duty twice, you can claim excise duty drawback on the UK excise duty that’s already been paid.

To claim excise duty, you must be classed as a ‘revenue trader’ by HMRC - a business that’s involved in producing or selling excise goods. Private individuals can’t claim excise duty drawback.

You can’t claim excise duty drawback on goods you send to the Isle of Man, because it uses the same excise duty system as the UK.

Chewing tobacco doesn’t qualify for excise duty drawback if you’re sending it to another EU 
country.

[Question for SME: is chewing tobacco subject to excise duty at both ends, or is there an alternative way of avoiding double taxation?]

## Selling goods directly to overseas consumers

$CTA

Most countries restrict the sale of excise goods, and most require duty guarantees before you send any goods. [Research the legal and tax situation](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides) before you send any goods overseas.

$CTA

All EU countries charge excise duty on excise goods. As the seller, you’re responsible for paying the duty.

EU countries may tell you to appoint a tax representative in their country (eg an accountant or law firm) to guarantee and pay the duty on your behalf.

[Question for SME: are accountants and law firms good examples?

If UK excise duty has already been paid on goods you sell overseas, you can claim it back through excise duty drawback.

## How to claim excise duty drawback

You must claim excise duty drawback within 3 years of the original duty payment.

The minimum amount you can claim is £500. If your claim is for less than £500, wait until you have other claims worth £500 in total, then send them together.

If you don’t make an excise duty drawback claim for 6 months, the minimum claim drops to £50.

s1. Before you send the goods, [notify HMRC online](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/forms/form/notice-of-intention-to-claim-drawback/new) that you’re going to make a claim for excise duty drawback. Or complete [form EX75](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374377/ex75.pdf) (PDF, 214KB) - sometimes called the ‘Notice of Intention’ or ‘NOI’ - and send it by post.

s2. Wait for at least 2 full business days in case HMRC decides to inspect the goods. For example, if HMRC receives your notification on the Monday, you can send the goods on the Wednesday. If HMRC receives the notification after 4pm, it counts as the following business day.

If your claim is successful, HMRC will pay the money into your bank account.
