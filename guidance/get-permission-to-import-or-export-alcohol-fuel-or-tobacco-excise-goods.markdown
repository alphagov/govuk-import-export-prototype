Excise goods are goods you have to pay [alcohol excise duty](/topic/business-tax/alcohol-duties), [fuel excise duty](/topic/business-tax/fuel-duty) or [tobacco excise duty](/topic/business-tax/tobacco-products-duty) on.

## Moving duty suspended excise goods within the EU

Duty suspended excise goods are alcohol, tobacco or fuel on which excise duty hasn’t been paid yet (eg because they’re going to be stored in a registered customs warehouse).

Only a registered consignee can move duty suspended excise goods in or out of the UK.

You can:

- [apply to be a registered consignee](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs/1.0/HM1&template=HM1.xdp) if you’re going to move excise goods regularly
- apply to be a temporary registered consignee to move excise goods as a one off (use form TRC1 to apply - call the HMRC imports and exports helpline to get a copy)
- get someone who’s already a registered consignee to move the goods for you

[Question for SME: is there a public list of registered consignees we can link to here?]

You need a [duty deferment account](/delay-paying-customs-duty-when-you-import-goods.html) to be a registered consignee.

You must pay excise duty in advance if you’re a temporary registered consignee, you can’t use a duty deferment account.

Applications take up to 9 weeks to process.

Once you’re registered, you’ll need to [make a report](link to ECMS content) through the Export Control Movement System (ECMS) when you move a consignment of goods.

## Bringing duty paid excise goods into the UK

To bring duty paid excise goods into the UK for business reasons (eg buying from a wholesaler or cash and carry in another EU country):

- fill in [form HM4](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/IndirectTax/1.0/HM4&template=HM4.xdp)
- send the form to the Duty Paid Team at HMRC

Include payment for the UK excise duty. Pay by BACS, banker’s draft, postal order or cheque.

You can only get authorisation for one consignment at a time.

$A
Duty Paid Team
HM Revenue and Customs
Local Compliance S0000

Your form must arrive at least 15 working days before the goods are dispatched.

HMRC will send the form back to you, endorsed with an HMRC authorisation number. 

### When you get the HMRC authorisation number

The HMRC authorisation number proves that you’ve paid the UK excise duty on the goods.

Give the HMRC authorisation number to your supplier. Once they have it, they can dispatch the goods.

Your supplier must include a Simplified Accompanying Administrative Document (SAAD) with the goods. To avoid delays, it’s best for them to include a copy of the endorsed form HM4 as well.

[Question for SME: I’d like to include a link to the SAAD form here, but I can only find details of the SAD: http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/general/sad/index_en.htm is It the same thing?]

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline if you change how much you’re ordering or decide to use a different supplier.

### When you receive the goods

When you receive the goods, you must:

- fill in the rest of form HM4 and send it to the HMRC Duty Paid Team within 4 working days
- include a copy of the SAAD

If you’re not VAT registered, you must include payment for import VAT. Pay by BACS, banker’s draft, postal order or cheque.

Contact the HMRC imports and exports helpline if the quantity delivered is different from what you ordered.

[Question for SME: do they also have to pay excise duty at this point?]

### Records you must keep

You must keep:

- a copy of form HM4
- copies 2 and 3 of the SAAD
- the [records required for revenue traders](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records)

[Question for SME: how long do they need to keep these records?]

## Import excise goods from outside the EU

You don’t need permission to import excise goods from outside the EU.

But you must pay the excise duty when you make your [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) unless they will be stored in a [registered excise warehouse](/government/publications/excise-notice-197-receipt-into-and-removal-from-an-excise-warehouse-of-excise-goods).

[Question for SME: is it right that you pay excise duty as part of the declaration?]
