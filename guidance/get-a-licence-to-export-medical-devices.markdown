You’ll need a Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) to export medical devices outside the EU. This includes both:

* general devices (eg stethoscope)
* specialist devices (eg implantable devices and devices used to test samples like calibrators)

[Question to SME: Are these appropriate examples, what is the common case here?]

You don’t need one to move them within the EU.

##Before you apply

The manufacturer, legal manufacturer or authorised representative must be based in the UK and the medical devices you’re exporting must have the following:

* a proof of manufacture 
* a CE marking or equivalent 

##How to apply

[Sign up](https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/CFS/cfsSystem.nsf/cfsRegA?Open) or [log in](https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/cfs/cfssystem.nsf/frmlogin) to apply for a CFS.

Contact the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) if you need help.

[Question for SME: Is there a cost? How long does it take to get one? What happens once they have the Certificate of Free Sale?]
