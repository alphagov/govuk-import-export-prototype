Some countries outside the EU need a Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) to export medical devices, such as:

* general devices like a stethoscope or prescription glasses
* specialist devices including implantable devices and devices used to test samples like calibrators

[Question to SME: Are these appropriate examples, what is the common case here?]

$CTA

Check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

$CTA

You don’t need a certificate to move medical devices within the EU.

##Before you apply

The manufacturer, legal manufacturer, authorised representative or distributor must be based in the UK and the medical devices you’re exporting must have the following:

* a proof of manufacture 
* a CE marking 

##How to apply

[Sign up](https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/CFS/cfsSystem.nsf/cfsRegA?Open) or [log in](https://aic.mhra.gov.uk/cfs/cfssystem.nsf/frmlogin) to apply for a CFS.

###Fees

Certificates cost £75 per order for the first 10 certificates you buy. Additional certificates on the same order cost £10 each.

Once you’ve paid, the CFS order will be posted to you within 5 working days.
