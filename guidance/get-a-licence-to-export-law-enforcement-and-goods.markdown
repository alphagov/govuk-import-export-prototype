There are trade controls on equipment, drugs or products that could be used for restraint, repression, capital punishment, torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

You must have a licence to supply:

- anything on the UK strategic export control lists to someone based outside the UK
- surveillance goods to Iran

There are different rules for exporting [drugs that can be used for lethal injections](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#lethal-injections).

There's an embargo (ban) on exporting equipment that could be used for internal repression to China.

$CTA

You could be fined or prosecuted if you don't get a licence when you need one. Your goods will also be delayed at customs and can be confiscated.

$CTA

If you’re exporting goods that are being picked directly from your place of work by your customer (‘ex-works goods’), tell them to check if they need an export licence.

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

$CTA

There’s no charge for a licence. You can read guidance on [how to use the SPIRE service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spire-online-export-licensing-guidance).

[ECO statistics data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/strategic-export-controls-licensing-data) has information on how long licence applications usually take based on the country you’re sending your goods to.

## How ECO decides whether to give licences

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.

ECO also looks at the ‘[incorporation factors](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020708/text/20708w01.htm#column_652)’ if the goods will be incorporated into military equipment which will then be exported to another country.

There’s a complete ban on exporting the following goods, unless they’re going to be displayed in a museum:

- gallows and guillotines
- electric chairs
- airtight vaults designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal gas
- automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances
- electric shock belts designed to restrain human beings by the administering electric shocks with a no-load voltage over 10,000 volts

## Brokering and arranging sales or movements

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in brokering goods on the UK strategic export control lists that could be used for restraint or inhumane treatment. This can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating contracts
* arranging or providing freight or transport services
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

### Brokering banned goods or to embargoed countries

There are tighter controls on brokering for some goods and for some locations.

For goods where there’s a total ban on UK exports (for example, automatic drug injection systems designed to execute people) or where there’s a UK embargo in place, brokering also includes: 

* general advertising and promotion (eg placing advertisements)
* finance, financial services, insurance or reinsurance services
* contract promotion activity

### Who the brokering rules apply to

The brokering rules apply to:

* companies or other bodies incorporated under UK law 
* UK nationals (including British citizens, British overseas territories citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British Overseas Citizens and ‘British subjects’ and ‘British protected persons’ under the British Nationality Act 1981)

The rules apply to UK nationals whether they have right of abode in the UK or not. They apply whether the UK national is working for a UK company, for a non-UK company or for themselves.

## Your licence responsibilities

You'll get an electronic copy of your licence through the SPIRE system.

You must include a copy of the licence with the shipping paperwork. If you’re posting the goods, you must include a copy of the licence in a separate envelope, attached to the package.

You are responsible for making sure that your export licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters).

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could be fined or prosecuted.

### If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) 

If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL), [check the terms of your OGEL](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels).

* [contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) in advance to arrange an inspection of your goods (goods must be available for inspection at least 3 days before the export date)
