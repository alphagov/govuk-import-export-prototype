You’ll need a licence to export ‘torture goods’. Torture goods include equipment, drugs or products that could be used for:

- capital punishment
- torture 
- cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment

This includes anything that could have legitimate applications but also be used to torture someone. These are called ‘dual use’ items.
