The UK strategic export control lists include equipment, drugs or products that could be used for:

- restraint (eg some types of shackles)
- repression (eg some types of riot control equipment, protective equipment and vehicles)
- capital punishment (eg drugs that may be used in lethal injections)
- torture 
- cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment

The rules apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

There's an embargo (ban) on exporting equipment that could be used for internal repression to China.

##Banned goods

You can’t export any of the following goods, unless they’re going to be displayed in a museum:

- gallows and guillotines
- electric chairs
- airtight vaults designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal gas
- automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances

##Exporting surveillance equipment to Iran

You also need a licence to export surveillance goods or services to Iran, including:

* equipment which might be used for the monitoring or interception of phone calls or digital communication (particularly if the direct or indirect 'end user' may be the Iranian government)
* any technical assistance, brokering services and financial assistance which relates to surveillance or surveillance goods

There's no charge for a licence.

## Trafficking, brokering and arranging sales or movements

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in trafficking or brokering goods on the UK strategic export control lists that could be used for restraint or inhumane treatment. 

Trafficking and brokering can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating contracts
* arranging or providing freight or transport services
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

### Trafficking or brokering banned goods or to embargoed countries

There are tighter controls on trafficking and brokering for some goods and for some locations.

For goods where there’s a total ban on UK exports (for example, automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances) or where there’s a UK embargo in place, trafficking and brokering also includes: 

* general advertising and promotion (eg placing advertisements)
* finance, financial services, insurance or reinsurance services
* contract promotion activity

[Question for Claire: is China the only country where there’s an embargo on goods that could be used for repression?]

[Question for Claire: the guidance currently published on GOV.UK suggests that the trafficking and brokering controls only apply to military and torture use goods (ie not dual use items). Is that right? Does that mean the EC controls on trafficking and brokering outlined in the EC ‘national measures’ document don’t apply, because the UK is a member of the EU?]

### Who the trafficking and brokering rules apply to

The trafficking and brokering rules apply to:

* companies or other bodies incorporated under UK law 
* UK nationals (including British citizens, British overseas territories citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British Overseas Citizens and ‘British subjects’ and ‘British protected persons’ under the British Nationality Act 1981)

The rules apply to UK nationals whether they have right of abode in the UK or not. They apply whether the UK national is working for a UK company, for a non-UK company or for themselves.
