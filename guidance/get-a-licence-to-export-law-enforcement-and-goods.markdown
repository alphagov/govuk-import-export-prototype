It’s a criminal offence to export ‘torture goods’ on the consolidated control lists outside the UK without the right licence.

$CTA

[Download the consolidated control lists](www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488993/controllist20151225.pdf) (PDF, 3.28 MB).

$CTA

Torture goods include equipment, drugs or products that could be used for:

- capital punishment
- torture 
- cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment

This includes anything that could have legitimate applications but also be used to torture someone. These are called ‘dual use’ items.

The rules for torture goods apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

##Banned goods

You can’t export any of the following goods, unless they’re going to be displayed in a museum:

- gallows and guillotines
- electric chairs
- airtight vaults designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal gas
- automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances
- electric shock belts designed to restrain human beings by the administering electric shocks with a no-load voltage over 10,000 volts

[Question for SME: how can exporters prove their goods are for museum use - do they need to be demonstrably inert/inactive?]
