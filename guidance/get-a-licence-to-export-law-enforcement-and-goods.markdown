It’s a criminal offence to export goods on the consolidated control lists outside the UK without the right licence.

$CTA

[Check the consolidated control lists using the Goods Checker tool](https://www.ecochecker.bis.gov.uk/spirefox5live/fox/spire/OGEL_GOODS_CHECKER_LANDING_PAGE/new) to see if you need a licence.

$CTA

The consolidated control lists includes equipment, drugs or products that could be used for:

- restraint (eg some types of shackles)
- repression (eg some types of riot control equipment and vehicles)
- capital punishment (eg drugs that may be used in lethal injections)
- torture 
- cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment

The rules apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

$CTA

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [see the country guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides).

$CTA

##Banned goods

You can’t export any of the following goods, unless they’re going to be displayed in a museum:

- gallows and guillotines
- electric chairs
- airtight vaults designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal gas
- automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances
- electric shock belts designed to restrain human beings by the administering electric shocks with a no-load voltage over 10,000 volts

[Question for SME: how can exporters prove their goods are for museum use - do they need to be demonstrably inert/inactive?]

##Exporting surveillance equipment to Iran

You also need a licence to export surveillance goods to Iran, including:

* equipment which might be used for the monitoring or interception of phone calls or digital communication (particularly if the direct or indirect 'end user' may be the Iranian government)
* any technical assistance, brokering services and financial assistance which relates to surveillance or surveillance goods
