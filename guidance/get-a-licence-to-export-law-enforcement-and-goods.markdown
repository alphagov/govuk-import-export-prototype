* restraint chairs

* leg-irons, gang-chains shackles and individual cuffs or shackle bracelets

* portable electric shock devices

* portable devices for riot control

* riot control incapacitate sprays

You’ll need a licence for information or services in any form. For example print, email, telephone, text message or electronic file transfers or carrying a laptop abroad containing information about controlled technology.

Even if your item isn't on the list, you must apply for a licence if the government tells you that you need one.

If you’re exporting goods that are being picked directly from your place of work by your customer (‘ex-works goods’), tell them to check if they need an export licence.

If you don’t get a licence for items that need one your goods will be delayed at customs. They could be confiscated and you could be fined or prosecuted - the rules apply both within the EU and outside the EU.

##Exporting surveillance equipment to Iran

You need a licence to export surveillance goods or services to Iran, including:

* equipment which might be used for the monitoring or interception of phone calls or digital communication (particularly if the direct or indirect 'end user' may be the Iranian government)
* any technical assistance, brokering services and financial assistance which relates to surveillance or surveillance goods

##Apply for an export licence
{:#apply}

Before you apply for an export licence, check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [research legal rules in overseas markets](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

Use the [SPIRE service](https://www.spire.bis.gov.uk/eng/fox/espire/LOGIN/login) to apply for an export licence.

There’s no charge for a licence. You can read guidance on [how to use the SPIRE service](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spire-online-export-licensing-guidance).

[ECO statistics data](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/strategic-export-controls-licensing-data) has information on how long licence applications usually take based on the country you’re sending your goods to.

## How ECO decides whether to give licences

ECO uses the [consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140325/wmstext/140325m0001.htm#14032566000018) to decide whether to give a licence.

ECO also looks at the ‘[incorporation factors](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020708/text/20708w01.htm#column_652)’ if the goods will be incorporated into military equipment which will then be exported to another country.

There’s a complete ban on exporting the following goods, unless they’re going to be displayed in a museum:

- gallows and guillotines
- electric chairs
- airtight vaults designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal gas
- automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances
- electric shock belts designed to restrain human beings by the administering electric shocks with a no-load voltage over 10,000 volts

## Brokering and arranging sales or movements

You must have a trade control licence if you or your company is involved in brokering goods on the UK strategic export control lists that could be used for restraint or inhumane treatment. This can include anything that helps to transfer items from one non-EU country to another. For example:

* arranging or negotiating contracts
* arranging or providing freight or transport services
* arranging intra company transfers
* drop shipping

### Brokering banned goods or to embargoed countries

There are tighter controls on brokering for some goods and for some locations.

For goods where there’s a total ban on UK exports (for example, automatic drug injection systems designed to execute human beings by the administering of lethal chemical substances) or where there’s a UK embargo in place, brokering also includes: 

* general advertising and promotion (eg placing advertisements)
* finance, financial services, insurance or reinsurance services
* contract promotion activity

[Question for Claire: is China the only country where there’s an embargo on goods that could be used for repression?]

[Question for Claire: the guidance currently published on GOV.UK suggests that the trafficking and brokering controls only apply to military and torture use goods (ie not dual use items). Is that right? Does that mean the EC controls on trafficking and brokering outlined in the EC ‘national measures’ document don’t apply, because the UK is a member of the EU?]

### Who the brokering rules apply to

The brokering rules apply to:

* companies or other bodies incorporated under UK law 
* UK nationals (including British citizens, British overseas territories citizens, British Nationals (Overseas), British Overseas Citizens and ‘British subjects’ and ‘British protected persons’ under the British Nationality Act 1981)

The rules apply to UK nationals whether they have right of abode in the UK or not. They apply whether the UK national is working for a UK company, for a non-UK company or for themselves.

## Your licence responsibilities

You'll get an electronic copy of your licence through the SPIRE system.

You must include a copy of the licence with the shipping paperwork. If you’re posting the goods, you must include a copy of the licence in a separate envelope, attached to the package.

You are responsible for making sure that your export licence is still valid when you export the goods.

Keep up to date with the [ECO notices to exporters](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters).

If you don’t comply with the terms of your licence it could be revoked, and you could be fined or prosecuted.

### If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) 

If you use an Open General Export Licence (OGEL), [check the terms of your OGEL](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels).

### If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL)

If you have a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL), you must:

* [contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) in advance to arrange an inspection of your goods (goods must be available for inspection at least 3 days before the export date)
* keep records of end user details
