Your used agricultural machinery may need to travel with a plant health certificate when you export outside the EU.

You don’t need to do any inside the EU.


##Exporting used farm machinery

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

[Check with the plant authority](https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/) in the country that you’re exporting to find if you need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export used farm machinery.

Make sure you ask to receive an official document to explain the rules in that country and how to comply - this will help UK inspectors to prepare your export correctly.


###Applying for a plant health certificate 

You must apply for your machinery to be inspected, either:

* [online through eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx) 
* by [filling in this form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536164/form-hh36a.pdf) and send it to [your local APHA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening)


###Fees  

It usually costs a minimum of £130.48 for a site inspection followed by tests.

If the inspection lasts more than 30 minutes, you’ll have to pay £65.24 for every every extra 15 mins.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with the importing country’s health rules.


###Reduced fees

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less than £5,000 in the last financial year
