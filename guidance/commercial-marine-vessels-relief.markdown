You can either claim money back (relief or drawback) on fuel for commercial marine voyages if you either:

* use it for commercial marine vessels
* export it outside the UK


##Fuel used on a sea voyage

You can claim relief on heavy oils (eg diesel) or light oils (eg petrol) that you use during a sea voyage if:

* the vessel isn’t a private pleasure craft
* during the voyage you’re either within the limits of a port or at sea at all times and not on any inland waterway

You can only claim for oil used within the last 3 years and on duty worth at least £250.

You can claim relief for voyages made between:

* a UK port and any foreign port
* UK ports - including returning to the same port
* within a port
* a UK port and a mooring at sea
* moorings at sea

###Who can claim

You can claim if you’re either:

* the vessel’s owner
* the commercial charterer or hirer
* the vessel’s master
* the vessel’s agent in that port
* a supplier of the oil acting as a sole agent

###How to claim

Fill in [form HO50](/government/publications/fuel-duty-claim-for-repayment-of-excise-duty-on-mineral-oil-used-on-commercial-vessels-ho50) to claim relief.


##Fuel used as ships’ stores

You can claim drawback on oils, including mixtures of oils, if they’re:

* loaded onto a ship for use as stores on a foreign voyage
* placed in a tax warehouse for use as ships’ stores

You can claim if the vessel weighs at least 40 tons net register tonnage (NRT) and is either leaving the UK to go to:

* a port outside the UK 
* an area of open sea outside the ‘Box’ - the seas within the latitudes 48°30’N and 61°1’N and longitude 12°0’W (the Skagerrak and the Kattegat)   

You can also claim if the vessel weighs less than 40 tons NRT, as long as the vessel weighs at least 200 tons gross and is going to a port outside the UK.

###How to claim

Fill in form HO66. Call HMRC to get form HO66.

##Keeping records

You must keep records for at least 6 years showing that the oils:

* have had excise duty paid at the rate you’re claiming for
* have been loaded onto a vessel as stores
* won’t be used to claim for relief of excise duty under any other scheme
