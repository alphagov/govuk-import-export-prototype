##Exporting live animals within the EU

You must have an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move the following animals within the EU:

- cattle
- sheep and goats
- pigs
- horses
- poultry 
- rabbits and hares
- cats, dogs and ferrets
- non-domestic ungulates (camelids, alpacas, llamas, non-domestic bovines, deer, pronghorns)

You must keep this document for at least 3 years.

###Using an existing ITAHC

You can get an existing ITAHC reissued by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animals you're exporting - you must [tell APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487433/form-exa31-livestock.pdf) (PDF, 755KB) and send it to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) - use [form EXA31 (Poultry)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487438/form-exa31-poultry.pdf) (PDF, 617KB) instead if you're exporting poultry or hatching eggs

###Applying for a new ITAHC

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply for a new ITAHC.

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 


##Exporting live animals outside the EU

You must get an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export live animals outside the EU. You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

There will usually already be an EHC for the type of live animal you’re exporting and where you’re sending it to.

Check the [List of EHCs that are available](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB) to see if the EHC you need already exists and is available for issue.

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of authorities in the destination country, and any other requirements they may have.

####Get an existing EHC issued

If the certificate you want already exists, and is available for issue, contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) and ask them to send you an application form and a copy of the EHC.

You must complete the application form and the EHC as fully as you can and send it back to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).

####Nominate an official veterinarian (OV)

You must nominate an OV when you apply for an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

To find an OV, you can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- contact the OV Team at the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester) or email the OV team <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> 

###Get your EHC signed

Check the Notes For Guidance that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Talk to [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new certificate

In some cases, there won’t be an available EHC that covers the type of consignment you want to send and the destination you’re sending it to.

This could be because:

- the EHC you want is on hold, for example, due to a trade ban enforced by the destination country
- there hasn’t been any previous demand for an EHC for the product you’re exporting to the destination country
- negotiations for the EHC you need are ongoing (agreeing new EHCs can take years, in some cases, or stall due to trade barriers)

If the EHC you want doesn’t exist, you should talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

You should send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).

The APHA will then pass the details on to Defra, who will consider negotiations for any new EHC.

###Exporting poultry

Before you export poultry outside the EU, check the wording of your EHC to see if you need to become a member of the [poultry health scheme](/guidance/poultry-health-scheme-how-to-register) (PHS).

###Exporting bees

For bee export certificates from England and Wales, contact the [National Bee Unit](http://www.nationalbeeunit.com/).

For bee exports from Scotland, contact [Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA)](http://www.sasa.gov.uk/).

##Exporting live animals through the EU to a non-EU country

If your consignment will travel through the EU on the way to a non EU country, you may need both an [Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC)](###Exporting live animals within the EU) and an [EHC](###get-an-export-health-certificate-ehc).

You should look at each stage of the journey and make sure your consignment has the right certification for each.

##Exporting horses and ponies

You must [get a horse passport](/horse-passport) for every horse you own.

If you’re exporting horses, their keeper or transporter must have each horse’s passport with them at all times.

You can be fined up to £5000 if one of your horses does not have a valid horse passport.

###Get an export welfare declaration

If you’re exporting horses and ponies in or outside of the EU, you must print and complete an export license application form, unless you have an exemption from the Secretary of State.

Download an [export license application form for horses taller than 147cm (14.2 hands)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413965/exh6.pdf) (PDF, 99.8KB).

Download an [export license application form for ponies or horses that are shorter than 147cm (14.2 hands)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413969/exh7.pdf) (PDF, 102KB)

You must make sure the pilot of the aircraft or master of the vessel that’s carrying the horses or ponies you're exporting has a copy of the export welfare declaration.

###When you don’t need an export welfare declaration

You don’t need an export welfare declaration if you’re moving:
- horses or ponies to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man
- horses over 147cm to the Republic of Ireland
- horses by direct flight to countries outside of Europe

Thoroughbred horses don’t need an export declaration if a steward or secretary of [the Jockey Club](http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/contact/contact) certifies that:
- they arrived in Great Britain no more than one month before the date of shipment for the purpose of being in a race
- they’re being shipped for a race or for training
- they’re being shipped to be used for breeding

###Exporting horses between the UK and France

You don’t need an export welfare declaration if you’re exporting:

- thoroughbreds used for racing, breeding, training or that are moving to be sold
- French registered Autre Que Pur Sang (AQPS) horses (a type of non-thoroughbred horse)
sports horses competing in Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) sponsored events
- horses registered on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register

You must make sure that each horse travels with a Commercial Document (DOCOM).

You can get the DOCOM you need through one of these bodies:

- [Weatherbys](https://www.weatherbys.co.uk/)- for thoroughbreds and horses on the Weatherby’s non-thoroughbreds register
- [British Equestrian Federation](http://www.bef.co.uk/Contact.aspx) - for FEI horses
- [British Horseracing Authority](http://www.britishhorseracing.com/bha/about-us/contact-bha/) - for racehorses
- 
##Exporting live fish or molluscs and crustaceans (shellfish)

You need a health certificate to export fish and shellfish (molluscs and crustaceans) within the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) if the species are:

- at risk of EU controlled diseases
- carriers of EU controlled diseases

###Get a health certificate

Complete the [Notification to export fish to the EU](/government/publications/notification-to-export-live-fish-and-shellfish-form-exp1) form and send it to the [Fish Health Inspectorate](/anchor) (FHI).

This is free, but you need to give 5 working days’ notice.

##Exporting live fish outside the EU

You must check with the destination country's [embassy](/government/world/embassies) that the fish you're exporting meeting their requirements. 

###Get a UK catch certificate

You need a UK catch certificate for marine caught fish for human consumption if you're exporting fish to:

- Iceland
- Ivory Coast
- Kuwait
- Madagascar
- Norway
- Thailand
- Tunisia
- Ukraine

You'll also need a UK catch certificate to export fish caught by a UK fishing vessel to a non-EU country (for example, for processing) and it’s re-imported back to the EU.

###How to apply

Complete a [UK catch certificate application form](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311517/uk-catch-certificate.pdf) (PDF, 95.1KB, 3 pages).

Email your completed form to <UKIUUCCC@mfa.gsi.gov.uk>.

If the fish has been sourced from more than one UK vessel then a [Multiple vessel schedule](/link) (MS Excel Spreadsheet, 524KB) will need to be completed and submitted alongside the catch certificate as an annex.

###When you don’t need a catch certificate

You don’t need a UK catch certificate to export:

- fish to another EU country
- outside the EU if the fish won’t be re-imported (apart from to the countries named above)
- farmed fish and shellfish
- freshwater fish
- some molluscs (including mussels, cockles, oysters, and scallops)
- fish fry or larvae

^If you’re exporting live fish from Scotland, contact Marine Scotland to get the certification.^

##Exporting display, laboratory, and research animals

You must have an animal health certificate to move any of the following:

- simian primates, monkeys and apes
- prosimian primates, eg lemurs, bushbabies, lorises, aye ayes and tarsiers
- ungulates (hooved animals) that aren’t farm animals, eg llamas, alpacas, antelopes, camels, wild pigs, tapirs, rhinos, - giraffes, elephants, hippos

- rodents, eg gophers, squirrels, mice, rats, hamsters, voles, beavers, gerbils
- semen or embryos that aren’t bovine or porcine

###Get an animal health certificate

You must ask your vet to do both of the following:

- inspect the animal, semen or embryos before they’re moved
- [complete the health certificates](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/) with the EU Trade Notification System (TRACES)

Before the move happens, your vet should also:

- tell the [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales
- tell [DARD](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact), if you’re in Northern Ireland

^You must make sure that animals or semen and embryos travel with their health certificates.^

###Get your holding registered or approved

Whether you need to get your holding registered or approved depends on the animals you want to move and the sites you want to send them to or receive them from.

Your holding will be considered unregistered if you don’t.

###When you need to get your holding registered

You must get your holding registered if you want to trade the following animals with registered or unregistered holdings in the EU:

- ungulates that aren’t livestock
- birds that aren’t commercial poultry
- rabbits and hares
- dogs, cats and ferrets that aren’t pets

Registered holdings can’t trade with approved holdings. 

###Register your holding

To register your holding, [complete form EC3163](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465097/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 120KB) and send it to:
- [your local APHA office](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales
- [your local DARD direct office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact), if you’re in Northern Ireland

You’ll be given a registration number which you’ll need to use on your animal health certificates.

###When you need to get your holding approved

You must get your holding approved if you want to trade carnivores or primates ,semen or embryos as well as the rest of the animals listed above.

Approved holdings must only take in animals from other approved holdings - [see a list of approved UK holdings](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489501/balai-directive-centres.pdf).

###How to get your holding approved

[Complete form EC3164](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487418/form-ec3163.pdf) (PDF, 172KB) and send it to your regional veterinary lead (RVL).

To find your RVL in England, Scotland and Wales contact your [local APHA office](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening).

Contact your local [DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) to find your RVL if you’re in Northern Ireland.

You must have your holding inspected by an animal health veterinary officer - APHA or DARD will arrange this.

The inspector will check your holding to make sure that it has:

- secure boundaries separating it from the surrounding area, eg walls, fences or other barriers
- equipment, facilities and staff to catch, confine and isolate animals
- quarantine facilities where you can isolate and test animals that come from non-approved holdings
- a surveillance programme for incoming animals that’s been agreed with your vet
- a clean and separated facility for carrying out post-mortems
- a system for disposing of carcasses that’s been agreed with your vet

You must also make sure you:

- keep records of animals’ age, sex, species, blood tests, and diseases
- employ an official veterinarian - contact your local APHA office or your DARD direct office to find one

You’ll be given an approval number to use on your animal health certificates.

###Re-inspection for approved holdings

If your holding is approved, it must pass an annual re-inspection, carried out by a whole-time veterinary officer (WTVO) - they’ll check it still meets the approval conditions.

It’s your responsibility to make sure your holding is annually re-inspected and re-approved, but the WTVO will usually contact you to arrange this.

####When approval gets suspended

If your approval is removed you’ll no longer be able to trade animals with other approved holdings.

####Diseases

Your regional veterinary laboratory (RVL) will temporarily suspend your holding’s approval if they find cases of:

- any [notifiable disease](/government/collections/notifiable-diseases-in-animals)
- viral enteritis or aleutian disease in mink
- tuberculosis in apes and non-domestic cats
- European foulbrood, varroasis or acariasis in bees
- myxomatosis, viral haemorraghic disease, tularaemia in rabbits and hares

####Breaking approval conditions
The RVL can also suspend your approval if your holding no longer meets any one of the approval conditions.

####How long suspensions last

The length of time the RVL suspends your approval for depends on the reason for the suspension.

You’ll be given time to fix the problem - if you don’t do this the RVL may withdraw your approval.

####When approval gets withdrawn

If you can’t prove to the RVL that your holding has fixed the problem which led to suspension, your approval may be withdrawn.

Approval for a holding will always be suspended before it’s withdrawn.

###Moving animals from approved holdings to registered holdings
If you want to move animals from an approved holding to a registered holding, you must contact either:
- the [APHA](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) if you’re in England, Scotland or Wales
- your [local DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) if you’re in Northern Ireland

##Exporting endangered animals

You must apply for a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) permit before you export endangered animals. 

Check if the animal you want to export is [controlled by CITES.](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.361.01.0001.01.ENG)

^You can’t export certain species to some countries - check the [CITIES trade suspension list](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php).^

###Apply for a CITES permit

##Exporting circus animals within the EU

You must register the circus and the animals with the APHA if you’re exporting the following animals kept for exhibition or entertainment within the EU:

- all mammals (including bats)
- birds
- bees
- salmon
- trout

^You don’t need to register when exporting circus animals within Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man or into non-EU countries.^

###What you need to do

You must:

- register the circus and animals
- get passports for all animals in the circus or act
- get an intra trade animal health certificate (ITAHC) before you travel
- keep animals registered as part of the circus away from unregistered animals
- put animals susceptible to rabies into quarantine when they enter the UK – see [rules for domestic animals](/guidance/pet-travel-quarantine) (for other species contact the APHA import team)

You must take the following documents with you when you travel:

- passports
- health certificate
- venue register

If your travelling circus has wild animals, you also need to [get a licence](/guidance/travelling-circus-with-wild-animals-get-a-licence).

%It’s an offence to travel with circus animals without registering – you can be prosecuted and fined up to £5,000.%

###Register your circus

Your application must be received at least 40 working days before you wish to travel.

s1. Make sure all tests and vaccinations for your animals are up to date.

s2. Choose an OV to carry out a registration visit - contact your [local APHA office](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) or [DARD office](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) to find one.  The OV will charge a fee for this.

s3. Complete the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/488776/form-et79.pdf) (PDF, 198KB) and send it to the address on the top of the form. You must include the £93 registration fee and passport fees.

s4. APHA sends the registration document, unique registration number and animal passports to your OV. 

s5. Your OV carries out a registration visit. If they’re satisfied with the checks, they’ll approve your application and give you the animal passports, registration document and a unique registration number for your circus or animal act.

s6. You receive a letter from the Centre for International Trade - Carlisle to confirm whether the registration is granted.

If you get new circus animals after you’ve registered, you need to contact the live animals team to arrange another OV visit.

###Animal passport fees

Animal passports cost:

- £2 for each individual circus animal ([dogs, cats or ferrets](/take-pet-abroad) and [horses](/horse-passport) need special passports)
- £2 for a group of birds or rodents (maximum of 15 ringed or microchipped birds or rodents per group, no limit on the number without rings or microchips)

You need a separate passport for each species and breed.

###Get an ITAHC

You need to apply for an ITAHC at least 10 days before travelling.

s1. Complete an [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) and and send it to [Centre for International Trade - Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc). You must include details of a nominated OV with your application. 

s2. APHA sends the health certificate to your OV to complete.

s3. Your OV visits you and certifies the health certificate. They’ll give you the ‘consignor confirmation form’. You must send this to APHA at least 48 hours before you travel to confirm that all animals in the health certificate are travelling.
