You need permission to export animal feed and pet food. What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-the eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-the-eu).

There are different rules if you’re exporting [processed animal proteins](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-furs-skins-and-other-animal-products.html) that will be made into animal food or any other animal by-products used in animal feed or pet food.

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

You don't need any special documents to move finished pet food or animal feed within the EU.

To export it outside the EU, you need to:

- apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)
- check if you need a certificate of free sale - ask the country you’re exporting to
 
These rules cover feed of both meat and plant origin.

###Apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you're exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet, or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk> .
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to you within xxx days/weeks.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). 
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animal products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.



###Apply for a certificate of free sale
The country you’re exporting to may require you to have a 'certificate of free sale'.

s1. Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484868/COFSApplicationExportNonEUFeeding_v2.0.doc) (MS Word Document, 127KB).
s2. Send it to <trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk>. 
s3. You’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.)

##Exporting feed with unauthorised additives outside the EU

Additives used in animal feed in the EU must be authorised. Check [part 1](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/docs/animal-feed-eu-reg-comm_register_feed_additives_1831-03.pdf) and [2](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/docs/animal-feed-eu-reg-comm_register_feed_additives_1831-03_annex2.pdf) of the EU register to see which ones are allowed.

You can export feed with unauthorised additives (those that aren’t on the lists) outside the EU if you get authorisation from the country you’re exporting to.

If you’re exporting via another EU country, you must also [contact the Food Standards Agency and Veterinary Medicines Directorate](https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/farmingfood/animalfeed/animalfeedlegislation/export-unauthorised-feed).
