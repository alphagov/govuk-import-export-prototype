You’ll need permission if you’re exporting pet food and animal feed to certain countries. 

##Within the EU 

You need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move food for animals within the EU. You need one for each product type.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Applying for an ITAHC

Apply by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of the animal food you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

Once you have your ITAHC, you must keep it for 3 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> or phone or write to the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester))

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

###If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal food

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply.

You may also need a Certificate of Free Sale (CFS) to export 

##Outside the EU

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export food for animals outside of the EU. 

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.


###Apply for an EHC

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB).

Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority] to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

Sometimes there won’t be an available EHC for your consignment and destination (eg because of a trade ban or lack of demand).

Talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

Send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.

##Get a Certificate of Free Sale 

If you’re exporting outside the EU, you may need a Certificate of Free Sale for the following products:

* protein crops for animals 
* animal feeding stuff
* pet food

Check with the importing country’s authority or embassy.

If you're asked for a CFS for animal food which isn’t on this list, contact the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).

###Apply

Fill in the [application](chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html)(MS Word Document, 122KB).

Send it to trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk, you’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit).

##If you need help

Contact the RPA.
