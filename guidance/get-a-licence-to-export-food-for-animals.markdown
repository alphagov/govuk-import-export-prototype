You need permission to export animal feed and pet food. What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-the eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-the-eu).

##Within the EU 

You need to apply for an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) if you move meat animal feed or pet food around the EU. You don't need an extra document for animal or pet feed of plant origin.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s3. Sign in to TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting.
s4. Contact the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) - tell them that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official veterinarian.

Instead of using TRACES,  you can fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf) (PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection. You must keep it for 3 years.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product, [contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc).

##Outside the EU

To export most types of animal feed and pet food outside the EU, you need to:

- apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)
- check if you need a certificate of free sale - ask the country you’re exporting to

###Apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC)

s1. Nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s2. Check the [list of EHCs](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Note the EHC number of what you’re exporting.
s3. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get the application form and a copy of the EHC. Tell them the EHC number you require and the details of your official veterinarian.
s4. Fill in the form and the EHC and return them. The address is on the form. 
s5. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check if your products meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.
s6. You may need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](/local-council). Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

###Apply for a certificate of free sale
The country you’re exporting to may require you to have a 'certificate of free sale'.

s1. Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484867/COFSApplicationExportNonEU_v2.0.doc) (MS Word Document, 127KB).
s2. Send it to <trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk>. 
s3. You’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.)

##Exporting feed with unauthorised additives outside the EU

Additives used in animal feed in the EU must be authorised. 

Check [part 1](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/docs/animal-feed-eu-reg-comm_register_feed_additives_1831-03.pdf) and [2](http://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/docs/animal-feed-eu-reg-comm_register_feed_additives_1831-03_annex2.pdf) of the EU register to see which ones are allowed.

You can export feed with additives that aren’t on this list outside the EU if you get authorisation from the country you’re exporting to.

If you’re exporting via another EU country, you must also [contact the Food Standards Agency and Veterinary Medicines Directorate](https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/farmingfood/animalfeed/animalfeedlegislation/export-unauthorised-feed).
