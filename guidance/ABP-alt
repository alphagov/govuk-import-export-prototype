You may need to follow special rules to export bones, skins and other animal by-products.

What you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting [within the EU](#within-eu) or [outside the EU](#outside-eu).

There are different rules for animal by-products:

- from [endangered animals](#endangered-animals)
- that will be [used as food](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-and-agricultural-products.html)

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Within the EU
{:#within-eu}

You must create a commercial document to move high risk category 1 category 2 animal by-products within the UK and the [EU](/eu-eea).

You can [check how your animal by-product is classified](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal). If you need help, [contact APHA].

If you're moving processed animal proteins, you always need a commercial document – even if the proteins are category 3.

###Create a commercial document

s1. [Register with the TRACES system](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do)
s2. [Sign in to TRACES](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/security/askLogin.do) and fill in the details of the animal by products you’re exporting.
s3. Your commercial document will be sent to you within xxx days.
s4. Attach the document your consignment when you transport it.

[Question for fact check: how long does it take for the commercial document to be sent to the exporter?]

Instead of using TRACES, you can create your own commercial document. It should include:

- details of the content of the consignment
- your contact details
- details of the business or person you’re sending your goods to

Follow the rules for [record keeping and labelling](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-by-product-categories-site-approval-hygiene-and-disposal#keepingrecords-and-labelling).

##Outside the EU
{:#outside-eu}

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal by-products and germplasm outside of the EU. 

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/491835/contacts-international-trade.pdf).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country, and who your official veterinarian is. You can find one by asking at your local vet or by emailing ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk (or contact [DEARA](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).
s3. You’ll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need your EHC signed by your official veterinarian or an inspector from your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).
s6. Your official veterinarian will be asked to check that your animals meet the requirements of the country you’re sending them to.

When you get your completed EHC, you must keep it for at least 2 years.

##Endangered animals

[Search for the animal you’re exporting](http://www.speciesplus.net/). It’s endangered if it’s listed as ‘appendix I’.

Within the EU, you usually can’t move by-products from endangered animals except in special cases (like for research necessary for the species to survive). [Contact APHA](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) to find out (or [DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland).

Outside the EU, you need to:

- check the [list of banned exports](https://cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php) - some animal by-products to certain countries are banned outright
- [apply for a CITES permit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423417/form-fed0172.pdf) (PDF, 98.5KB), if the animal isn’t banned

Send the permit application form by post or email to [APHA](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-circus-endangered-research-animals.html#contacts) ([DEARA](https://www.dardni.gov.uk/contact) in Northern Ireland), including the [fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/355264/cites-ag-ct-01.pdf) (PDF, 146KB).

APHA will contact you within 15 working days of receiving your application.
