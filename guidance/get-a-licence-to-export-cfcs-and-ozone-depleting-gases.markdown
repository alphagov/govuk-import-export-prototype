You can only export ozone-depleting substances (ODS) outside the EU in special situations. You can get an export licence for:

- HCFCs used for refrigeration, foam blowing fire-fighting or solvents 
- CFCs or CTCs for laboratory or analytical use
- all ODS used for feedstock
- [other special situations](https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/6e32df10-ab7d-4bc0-83e1-ae3ef90cc45e/0%20General%20Informaton%20manual%20EN%20v1.0)


[Apply for an export licence](http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ozone/ods/) on the European Commission website.


[Questions for SME: How long does it take to get a licence? How much does it cost? What does an exporter do with the licence when they've got it? Is there a list of these ODS that we can link to?]

##HFCs and other F-gases

HFCs and other [F-gases](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-f-gas-regulation-guidance-for-users-producers-and-traders#regulated-gases-and-supporting-guidance) are also used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, solvents or aerosols.

You don’t need a licence to export HFCs and other F-gases, but you may need to [submit an annual report](/guidance/f-gas-exporters-record-keeping-and-reporting-requirements) about your exports.
