To export outside the [EU](/eu-eea), what you need to do depends on whether you’re exporting:

- [ozone-depleting substances](#ozone) like HCFCs or CFCs
- [HFCs and other F-gases](#fgas)

Within the EU, you don’t need a licence.

Also check the import rules of the country you’re importing to. Talk to your importer or get help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##Ozone-depleting substances
{:#ozone}

You can only export ozone-depleting substances (ODS) in certain situations, including:

- HCFCs used for refrigeration, air conditioning, foam blowing fire-fighting or solvents 
- CFCs or CTCs for laboratory or analytical use
- all ODS used as part of a chemical process to create another substance ('feedstock')
- recovered, recycled or reclaimed halons stored for critical uses, for example in aircraft extinguishing systems
- [other special situations](https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/6e32df10-ab7d-4bc0-83e1-ae3ef90cc45e/0%20General%20Informaton%20manual%20EN%20v1.0)

[Apply for an export licence](http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ozone/ods/) on the European Commission website.

You'll usually get a licence within 15 to 29 days if you've just registered or within 5 days if you're already signed up on the system.

Attach a copy to your consignment or give your freight forwarder your licence number.

###After you export

Every year you must report the ODS chemicals you’ve exported by 31 March.

You'll need to:

- [register for an account](https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/registry/self_register)
- [log in to submit your report](https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/acl_users/cookie_auth/login_form?came_from=/)"

##HFCs and other F-gases
{:#fgas}

HFCs and other [F-gases](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/eu-f-gas-regulation-guidance-for-users-producers-and-traders#regulated-gases-and-supporting-guidance) are also used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, solvents or aerosols.

You don’t need a licence to export HFCs and other F-gases, but you may need to [submit an annual report](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/f-gas-exporters-record-keeping-and-reporting-requirements) about your exports.
