You’ll need certificates and licenses when you’re exporting food or anything that will be eaten by humans.

## Animal products within the EU 

You need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move animal products that are used as food within the EU. This includes:

* fresh and game meat
* fish and seafood
* eggs
* honey and royal jelly
* snails
* frogs' legs
* blood and blood products
* bone
* animal casing
* lard and rendered fat
* gelatine

You need one for each product type.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Applying for an ITAHC

Apply by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

Once you have your ITAHC, you must keep it for 3 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> or phone or write to the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester))

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

###If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply.

##Plant products within the EU

You won't need a certificate to move plants which will be used as food in most cases.

Certain species will require a plant passport or a supplier document within the UK or the EU.

###When you need a plant passport or document

Check if your plants need a passport for:

* all mouvements [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446525/plant-passports-plant-products.pdf)(PDF, 212KB) or [to Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447496/plant-passports-switzerland-1.pdf)(PDF, 108KB)

* protected zones [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446531/plant-passports-protected-zones.pdf)(PDF, 252KB) or [within Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447499/plant-passports-switzerland4.pdf)(PDF, 201KB)

You also need to check if your [fruit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446540/plant-passports-fruit-plants.pdf) or [vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446542/plant-passports-veg-plants.pdf) need a supplier document.

Seed potatoes always need a plant passport when moved around the UK or the EU. They must be part of the [Seed Potato Classification Scheme (SPCS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme).

###When you don't need a supplier document

You don't need a make supplier documents if:

* your goods are for retail sale
* you're a small producer selling to the local market - you must sell your produce within a 50 metres radius of your site and mark it 'for direct sale to the public only'.

You're considered a small producer if:

* you don't trade in plants that are covered by the plant passport scheme
* you have less than 1,000 metres squared of plants overall and less than 100 metres squared is under protection
* the charge for 2 inspections would be more than 10% of your turnover

##Get permission to make passports or supplier documents

You need to either:

* complete the [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-passports-application) and [send it to APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate)

* [register for eDomero](https://signon.defra.gov.uk/Login.aspx) and do it online

They’ll inspect your plants and you’ll get a unique registration number if you pass.
 
Your permission will last a year but you may need more inspections if your site has a higher risk of diseases.

^You only need to apply to make supplier documents separately if you're not already authorised to issue plant passports.

### Inspection fees

You’ll have to pay £46.10 for every 15 mins that an inspection takes, including the time it takes inspectors to travel to your site.

The minimum fee for any inspection is £92.19. 

You have to pay these fees again if you renew your application the next year.

You won’t have to pay if APHA only authorises you to make supplier documents.

###Creating a standard passport 

You can make this in different formats.

If you use a label or sticker you have to make one for each plant of the same kind, grown by the same producer and going to the same place. 

You can also create a single delivery note for the whole consignment (including plants which don’t need a passport).

In all cases label them ‘EU Plant Passport’ and include:

* ”‘UK” and “EW” (this is the code for APHA)
*  your unique APHA registration number and an individual serial, week, batch or invoice number
*  the botanical name of the plant or plants 
*  the quantity
*  the letters ‘ZP’ and a protected zone code when you’re moving plants in these places
*  the country of origin of the consignment, if it’s originally come from a non-EU country

###Making a plant passport for fruit

It must include all standard passport details and you must confirm that the fruit either:

* is free of pests and diseases
* has a [Plant Health Propagation Scheme (PHPS)](https://www.gov.uk/plant-health-propagation-scheme) grade - state the grade on the passport

### Replacement plant passports

You need replacement passport if you split a consignment of plants which already have a passport, it must include all standard passport details and:

* the letters 'RP' - for replacement passport
* the registration number of the original supplier

[Question for SME: Do we need to add that the original supplier might be them?]

If you don't want to share supplier details you can put your own code on the passport and record the supplier number in case AHPA ask.

###Creating a supplier document

If you want to create a supplier document you can follow the same process but add:

* “EU Quality”
* the date you make it 
* your company name
* the common name for vegetables

If you’re moving a mix of plants that need passports and supplier documents just add “EU Label” to the existing the passport.

## Keeping records

You must keep all plant passports that you issue for 1 year so that APHA can investigate any pest or disease outbreaks.

You don’t have to keep supplier documents, unless part of them forms the plant passport.

## Paying APHA to issue plant passports

You can also [contact APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) and pay them to issue plant passports for you.

##Outside the EU

###Health Certificates

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal products which are eaten by humans outside of the EU. 

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.

###Apply for an EHC

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB).

Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority] to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

Sometimes there won’t be an available EHC for your consignment and destination (eg because of a trade ban or lack of demand).

Talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

Send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.

##Get a Certificate of Free Sale for food

If you’re exporting outside the EU, you may need a Certificate of Free Sale. Check with the importing country’s authority or embassy.

They may be required for the following products:

* manufactured foods
* soft drinks
* health food supplements
* food additives
* tea, coffee, cocoa
* herbs and spices
* alcoholic drinks
* milk and dairy
* sugar and sugar products
* malt and flour

If you need a CFS for food which isn’t on this list, contact the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).

###Apply

Fill in the [application](Application for Certificates of Free Sale for export to non-EUcountries )(MS Word Document, 127KB).

Send it to trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk, you’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.)

###If you need help

Contact the RPA.

##Exporting plants from England or Wales

You’ll need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export plants that will be used as food like:

* fruit and vegetables
* potatoes (including seed potatoes)
* grain - there are different rules for this

Check if you need an importing permit in the country you're exporting your goods to.

###Getting a plant health certificate in England and Wales (except grain)

In most cases you can send your food to the APHA lab for inspection, it’ll be tested and you’ll receive your certificate in 7 days if you pass.

If you’re already part of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme) you may be able to show your results to get your certificate.

[Question for SME: Do you growing season inspections also apply to food?]

###Apply for inspection

You must fill in a form and send it to [your local AHPA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate), for:

* [plants, including fruit and vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    

* [potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)      

* there’s a different [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf) if you’re exporting goods (with a certificate) which came back to England or Wales from a non-EU country and were stored, repacked, or split up

Contact APHA to check if the country you’re exporting to requires you to test the soil that your crops are grown in - you may need to fill in a [soil form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling).  

Ask if you need to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export. The USA, New Zealand and other countries require this.

[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]
[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]

###Fees  

It costs £13.87 to get a plant health certificate and £36.35 for a lab examination.

If an inspector needs to come to your site to test soil it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes and a minimum of £99.36.

There might be additional charges if your goods need more tests to comply with importing country’s health rules.

[Question for SME: Does the inspection fee include a certificate or do you need pay a certificate fee on top of that?]

###Reduced fees

You may be entitled to a 50% discount for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if you’re both:

* not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5000 in the last financial year

Fill in this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) to apply.

You must tell AHPA when you are no longer eligible for this concession

##Exporting grain from England and Wales

Before you export, check if:

* you need a plant health certificate to export grain - [contact AHPA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) if you’re exporting to a country which is not on this list

* you’re exporting to countries that require you for a sample test - this means that you need to send a 1kg sample to an official laboratory before your grain leaves the UK 
 
* the country you’re exporting to asks for an import permit - you’ll need to contact them to get this and keep a copy

Sometimes you’ll also need a declaration to add to your plant certificate to prove you’ve tested for certain pests. This is required in:

* Hungary for acarus siro L  
* Vietnam for tilletia indica (karnal bunt) only  
* Kyrgyzstan for tilletia indica and Trogoderma granarium

[Question for SME: How do users do this? It’s not on the form]

All grain will need to be tested by a trade inspector 

[Question for SME: Is this list up to date?]

###Applying for a plant health certificate

s1. If you don’t need to send a sample fill in all 3 sections of this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf)(PDF, 286KB) or if you do, complete complete sections I and 2 to send with your 1kg sample. 
s2. If you’re sending goods to Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, China or Vietnam prepare a second 1 kg sample for the official lab in a paper bag sealed inside a plastic bag.
s3. Send your form 5 days before you want to export, if you’re unable to, please [contact AHPA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).
s4. Contact the port you’re exporting from to ask a trade inspector to inspect your grain (they must have a special AHPA qualification to check it).  

[Do users need to know about the country specific tests for Cuba and Vietnam or will the inspectors know what to test for according to the destination country?]

###If you pass the inspection

You must fill in a another copy of this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf)

###If you fail the inspection

You’ll need to have your grain treated by a professional company.

It will usually take from 10 to 20 days for your grain to be ready for export but you may be able to get your grain treated in transit.

###Fees

You must pay:

* £59.53 to get phytosanitary certificates
* £59.53 for a trade inspector to inspect your grain
* £59.53 to APHA, if the country you’re exporting to demands that you send samples to test for specific pests

Small importers will be eligible for a [discounted fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-export-services-application-for-concessionary-rates).

##Exporting plants or grain from Scotland or Northern Ireland

Contact Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture (SASA) if you’re exporting from Scotland:

** Horticulture & Marketing Unit **      
<hort.marketing@scotland.gsi.gov.uk>    
Telephone: 0131 244 8935

A20 Roddinglaw Road,
Edinburgh 
EH12 9FJ 

[Contact the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Northern Ireland (DARDNI)](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) if you’re exporting from Northern Ireland.

##Get a license to export agricultural products 

If you’re exporting some agricultural products called Common Agriculural Policy (CAP) goods in [large quantities](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections) you may need an mandatory export licence for:

* sugar
* cereals and rice 

###Applying

You need to:

s1. Call the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to get a your trader registration number 
s2. Fill in this [form](chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html) or apply in another format as long as you give the same information
s3. Pay a “security” deposit (ask the RPA how to calculate this and when it will be returned) - if you’re applying for a tender licence you’ll only need to pay this if your quote is accepted
s4. You licence will be issued on the CHIEF system within 5 days and will appear when you make your declaration(link to declaration content). You can also ask for a paper one if the countries you're trading with require this.

If you want to send your application by email rather by than fax or post you need to [get approval](chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html?uuid=a5765123-3a7c-450e-e981-9c5e37f84ad1).

If you'd like to cancel or amend your application you must do this before 12 pm on the day you apply.

You can export 105% of the quantity you put on the form without having to get a new licence.

###Calculate your security rate

Your security rate for rice and cereals will be 3 euros per tonne.

Check the table to see how much you need to pay for sugar:

| sugar commodity code | security rate for 100 kilos |
|------------------------|------------------|
| 1701 | €11 |
| 1702, 2106 and 1702 6095 | €4.2 |
| 1703 (molasses) | €0.9 |
| 1702 6080 (inulin syrup) | €8 |
| 1701 (non-quota sugar) |  €0.3 |
| 1702 9080 (inulin syrup) | €0.6|

You don’t need to pay a security if you meet the conditions of your licence and:

* your total comes to €100 or less
* your total comes to €500 but you commit to paying any invoices sent by the RPA if the conditions of your licence arn't  met.[link to form]
* you're a humanitarian organisation exporting goods for aid 

[Question for SME: Is there a version of the €500 form which isn’t embedded within the leaflets? It seems that calling RPA to get the words might not be that efficient?]

###How to pay 

You can do so:

* in a single payment in [pounds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439547/fdgs6t_-_IX6S_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 132KB) or [euros](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439546/fdgs13_-_IX6U_-_V4.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 159KB)

* in a group or 'block' payment in [pounds](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439549/fdgs7t_-_IX7_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 101KB) or [euros](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439544/fdgs10t_-_IX5U_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 43.2KB)

* by cash, cheque, banker's draft or any other payments agreed by the RPA 

If you choose block payments you should receive statements from the RPA to tell you how much you still owe. You can commit to the block payments as a [group of traders](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439549/fdgs7t_-_IX7_-_V2.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 51.7KB). You can also apply to [change the name](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439550/fdgs5_-_IX8_-_v5.0_Jun_2015.pdf)(PDF, 65.3KB) on the 'contract'.

Pay your security to:

Bank: RBS (NatWest) 
Sort code: 60-70-80 
Account number: 550/00/85014583 
BIC: NWBKGB2L 
IBAN: GB48 NWBK 6072 0385 0145 83 

###Getting your security back

Your security will be refunded in full if you export at least 95% of the quantity on the licence within 2 months of its expiry date - this will happen automatically if you used CHIEF.

If you're using a paper licence, you'll need to return it to the RPA within 2 months of its expiry with any supporting documents and your securities will usually be returned to you within 21 days of receiving your proof.

If you're late or fail to do this, you won't get your full security back or won't get it back at all.

If you use your licence in stages, you can ask us for the security in stages, as long as you can prove that at least 5% of the total quantity has been imported or exported.
