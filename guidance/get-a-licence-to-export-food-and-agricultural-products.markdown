You’ll need certificates and licenses when you’re exporting food or anything that will be eaten by humans.

## Animal products within the EU 

You need an Intra Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC) to move animal products that are used as food within the EU. These include:

* fresh and game meat
* fish and seafood
* eggs
* honey and royal jelly
* snails
* frogs' legs
* blood and blood products
* bone
* animal casing
* lard and rendered fat
* gelatine

You need one for each product type.

[Question for SME: how much does it cost to get a certificate?]

[Question for SME: what do you need to do with your certificate when you have it? Is it a case of attaching it to your export declaration?]

###Applying for an ITAHC

Apply by using the EU’s Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES). 

You can either:

- [register](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/sanco/traces/registration/open.do) with TRACES and fill in the details of animal product you're exporting - you must tell the [Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening) that the ITAHC has been created and give them details of your official vet (OV)
- fill in [form EXA31](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487419/form-exa31.pdf)(PDF, 657KB) and send it to the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) 

Once you have your ITAHC, you must keep it for 3 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) to inspect your goods when you apply. You can either:

- ask your local veterinary practice if there’s an OV working there
- email <ovteam@alpha.gsi.gov.uk> or phone or write to the [Specialist Service Centre Worcester](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centre-worcester))

Your ITAHC will be valid for 10 days after the inspection.

[Question for SME: Does the exporter need to do anything else once the vet has signed it?]

###If there isn’t an ITAHC for your type of animal product

[Contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#specialist-service-centres-ssc) to apply.

##Plant products within the EU

If you’re moving certain plants which will be used as food within the UK or the EU, you might need a passport, a supplier documents or both.

###When you need a plant passport or document

Check if your plants need a passport for:

* all mouvements [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446525/plant-passports-plant-products.pdf)(PDF, 212KB) or [to Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447496/plant-passports-switzerland-1.pdf)(PDF, 108KB)

* protected zones [in the EU including the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446531/plant-passports-protected-zones.pdf)(PDF, 252KB) or [within Switzerland](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447499/plant-passports-switzerland4.pdf)(PDF, 201KB)

You also need to check if your [fruit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446540/plant-passports-fruit-plants.pdf) or [vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446542/plant-passports-veg-plants.pdf) need a supplier document.


##Outside the EU

###Health Certificates

You need an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export animal products which are eaten by humans outside of the EU. 

You must check that your EHC meets the requirements of the country you’re exporting to and if there are any other rules.


###Apply for an EHC

Check the [list of EHCs that are available](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/479776/ehc-list.pdf) (PDF, 286KB).

Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) to get application form and a copy of the EHC.

Send the form and EHC back to them once you've completed both.

You must keep this document for at least 2 years.

###Nominate a vet

You must nominate an official veterinarian (OV) when you apply to get an EHC.

Your OV can carry out any examination, inspection, testing, sampling or treatment to check if a consignment meets the requirements of the destination country.

###Get your EHC signed

Check the ‘Notes For Guidance’ that come with your EHC to find out if you need to get it signed by a local authority inspector or OV.

Contact [your local authority] to get your EHC signed by an inspector.

###Create a new EHC

Sometimes there won’t be an available EHC for your consignment and destination (eg because of a trade ban or lack of demand).

Talk to your importer to find out about import conditions in the country you want to export to.

Send any officially-issued import conditions to [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle) for them to consider negotiating a new EHC.

##Get a Certificate of Free Sale 

If you’re exporting outside the EU, you may need a Certificate of Free Sale. Check with the importing country’s authority or embassy.

They may be required for the following products:

* manufactured foods
* soft drinks
* health food supplements
* food additives
* tea, coffee, cocoa
* herbs and spices
* alcoholic drinks
* milk and dairy
* sugar and sugar products
* malt and flour

If you need a CFS for food which isn’t on this list, contact the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).

###Apply

Fill in the [application](Application for Certificates of Free Sale for export to non-EUcountries )(MS Word Document, 127KB).

Send it to trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk, you’ll usually get your certificate within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit.)

##If you need help

Contact the RPA.

##Exporting plants outside the EU from England or Wales

You’ll need a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) to export plants that will be used as food to most EU countries, these include:

* fruit and vegetables
* potatoes (including seed potatoes)
* grain - there are different rules for this

###Getting a plant health certificate in England and Wales (except grain)

In most cases you can send your food to the APHA lab for inspection, it’ll be tested and you’ll receive your certificate in 7 days if you pass.

If you’re already part of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme) you may be able to show your results to get your certificate.

###Apply for inspection

You must fill in a form for:

*[plants, including fruit and vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)  

*[potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)  

[Question for SME: Is eDomero still in use? It is not mentioned in any of the current guidance]

There’s a different [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf) if you’re exporting goods (with a certificate) which came back to England or Wales from a non-EU country and were stored, repacked, or split up.  

Contact APHA to check if the country you’re exporting to requires you to test the soil that your crops are grown in - if you grow potatoes, you may need to fill in a [soil form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling).  

Ask if you need to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export. The USA, New Zealand and other countries require this.  

###Fees  

It usually costs £13.87 to get a plant health certificate if you don’t need an inspection or laboratory examination.

If you need to test soil samples, the certificate will cost a minimum of £99.36

###Reduced fees

You may be entitled to 50% discount for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year

If you’re both:

* not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5000 in the last financial year

Fill in this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) to apply.

^You must tell AHPA when you are no longer eligible for this concession

##Exporting grain from England and Wales

Before you export, check:

* if you need a plant health certificate to export grain - [contact AHPA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) if you’re exporting to a country which is not on this list

* if you’re exporting to countries that require you for a sample test - this means that you need to send a 1kg sample to an official laboratory before your grain leaves the UK 
 
* if the country you’re exporting to asks for an import permit - you’ll need to contact them to get this and keep a copy

Sometimes you’ll also need a declaration to add to your plant certificate to prove you’ve tested for certain pests. This is required in:

* Hungary for acarus siro L  
* Vietnam for tilletia indica (karnal bunt) only  
* Kyrgyzstan for tilletia indica and Trogoderma granarium

[Question for SME: How do users do this? It’s not on the form]

^All grain will need to be tested by a trade inspector

##Applying for a plant health certificate

s1. If you don’t need to send a sample fill in all 3 sections of this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf)(PDF, 286KB) or if you do, complete complete sections I and 2 to send it with your 1kg sample. 

s2. If you’re sending goods to Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, China or Vietnam prepare a second 1 kg sample for the official lab in a paper bag sealed inside a plastic bag.

s3. Send your forms 5 days before you want to export, if you’re unable to, please [contact AHPA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).

s4. Contact the port you’re exporting from to ask for a trade inspector to inspect your grain (they must have a special AHPA qualification to check it).

[Do users need to know about the country specific tests for Cuba and Vietnam or will the inspectors know what to test for according to the destination country?]

###If you pass the inspection

You must fill in a another copy of this [form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf)

###If you fail the inspection

You’ll need to have your grain treated by a professional company.

It will usually take from 10 to 20 days for your grain to be ready for export.

###Fees

You must pay:

* £59.53 to get phytosanitary certificates
* £59.53 for a trade inspector to inspect your grain
* £59.53 to APHA, if the country you’re exporting to demands that you send samples to test for specific pests
Small importers will be eligible for a [discounted fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-export-services-application-for-concessionary-rates).

##Exporting plants or grain outside the EU from Scotland or Northern Ireland

[Contact the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Northern Ireland (DARDNI)](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact) if you’re exporting from Northern Ireland.

##Get a license to export agricultural products

If you’re exporting some agricultural products in [large quantities](https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff/sections) you may need an mandatory export licence for:

* sugar
* cereals and rice 

If you’ve given a quote to public authority outside the EU you can get a licence  in advance to speed up the process. This applies to goods like:

* dairy products
* fresh or processed meat (including edible offal)
* sugar, syrup, molasses and honey
*cereals and rice (including milled products, starch, gluten and insulin)
* eggs
* fresh or processed fruit and vegetables
* coffee, tea and spices
* cocoa beans and shells
* oils and fats
* fish, crustaceans and molluscs (fresh or processed)
* fermented drinks
* tobacco
* cork  
* flax and hemp  
* processed goods, eg products such as biscuits which have one or more of the goods listed above as a basic ingredient

###Applying

You need to:

s1.Call the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to get a your trader registration number and check if you need a licence or if there is a levy on your goods

s2.Fill in this [form](chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html) or apply in another format as long as you give the same information

s3. Provide a “security” deposit this will be returned to you (ask the RPA how to calculate this) - if you’re applying for a tender licence you’ll only need to pay this if your quote is accepted

s4. Get a paper licence to attach to your goods or add one to your CHIEF declaration(link to declaration content)

If you want to send your application by email rather by than fax or post you need to [get approval](chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html?uuid=a5765123-3a7c-450e-e981-9c5e37f84ad1)

[Question for SME: The form appears to be out of date. Is there a new one?]

###Tender licences

You usually have 21 days to let the RPA if your quote has been accepted. 

If your tender deadline is extended by 10 days, you can get an extra 21 days to let the RPA know if it’s been accepted. 

If it’s extended by more than 10 days you’ll have to apply for a new licence.

[Question for SME: The guidance says that “you can apply for a tender licence up to 15 days before but no later than midday on the closing date for submitting tenders. What is the closing date?]
