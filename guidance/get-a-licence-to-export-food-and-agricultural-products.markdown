##Processed food and drinks
{:#processed-foods}

Within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea) you don't need a certificate or to follow special rules to move processed foods or drinks.

Outside the EU, check with the food authority in country you're exporting to. They'll tell you if you need 'certificates of free sale' and which types they require. They'll also tell you if they require other types of export certification

If your food or drink contains animal products, also check if you need an [export health certificate](#meat-dairy-animal-products-outside-EU) (this is only required in special cases).

There’s a [ban on exporting caviar, caviar substitutes, truffles and goods containing truffles to North Korea](/guidance/exporting-luxury-goods-north-korea.html).

###Apply for a certificate of free sale

Fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/484867/COFSApplicationExportNonEU_v2.0.doc) (MS Word Document, 127KB).

Send it to <trader@rpa.gsi.gov.uk>. The certificate will usually be issued within 5 working days.

It’s free to apply and the certificates don’t expire (unless the country you’re exporting to specifies a time limit).

###If you need help

Contact the Rural Payments Agency (RPA).

**Rural Payments Agency**         
Telephone:  03300 416 500
Monday to Friday: 8.30am to 5pm
[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)    

###Getting another type of export certification

If you’re asked for another type of export certificate for non animal products and your product was manufactured in the UK, [contact the local authority where your products was made](http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/find-food-safety-team) with the details of what the importing country requires.

##Meat, dairy and other animal products
{:#meat-dairy-animal-products}

You need to follow special rules to export animal products that will be used as food, for example:

- frozen or fresh meat and fish
- dairy products
- honey
- gelatine, lard or blood

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#meat-dairy-animal-products-within-EU) or [outside the EU](#meat-dairy-animal-products-outside-EU).

$CTA

There are different rules for animal products that will be used as [food for animals](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-food-for-animals.html).

$CTA

###Within the EU
{:#meat-dairy-animal-products-within-EU}

You need to create a commercial document for animal products which will be eaten by humans. 

It should include:

* details of the content of the consignment
* your contact details
* details of the business or person you're sending your goods to

Once you've completed it, attach it to your consignment.

###Outside the EU
{:#meat-dairy-animal-products-outside-EU}

You need to apply for an Export Health Certificate (EHC) to export unprocessed animal products outside the EU.

There is a ban on most food exports to Russia, ask the Centre for International Trade for details.

s1. Contact the [Centre for International Trade Carlisle](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#centre-for-international-trade-carlisle).
s2. Tell them what you’re exporting and the destination country. If your goods won’t be used as food, you’ll be asked to nominate an official veterinarian to inspect your goods. To find one, ask at your local vet or email <ovteam@apha.gsi.gov.uk>.
s3. You'll be given the application form for the EHC you need. Fill it in and return it to the address on the form.
s4. Your EHC will be sent to your local authority or official veterinarian within 7 working days.
s5. Arrange for your goods to be inspected by your local authority or official veterinarian. They’ll check the goods meet the requirements of the EHC.
s6. Check your EHC’s guidance notes to find out if you need it signed by the inspector.

There’s no fee for the certificate but you’ll be charged for your vet or local authority inspector’s time.

##Vegetables, fruit and other plants used as food
{:#plants}

What you need to do depends on if you’re exporting [within the EU](#plants-within-EU) or [outside the EU](#plants-outside-EU).

###Within the EU
{:#plants-within-EU}

Check if your [fruit](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446540/plant-passports-fruit-plants.pdf) or [vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446542/plant-passports-veg-plants.pdf) need a supplier document.

If you need a supplier document, contact the [Plant Health Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health-offices) to apply.

If you don't need one, you don't have to do anything to move plants used as food within the EU. But you always have to comply with the normal standards to [sell fresh fruit and vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/comply-with-marketing-standards-for-fresh-fruit-and-vegetables).


[Question for SME: Am I right in thinking supplier documents are free and that they are required for food?]

###Outside the EU
{:#plants-outside-EU}

Most countries require you to have a health certificate (‘phytosanitary certificate’) if you export fruit, vegetables or other plants to be used as food. 

Check with the country that you’re exporting to find if you need a certificate.

There are different rules for [grain](#grain).

$CTA

You apply a different way to export plants from [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

$CTA

###Apply for a plant health certificate

You must usually apply for your plants to be tested before you get a plant health certificate. 

$CTA

If you're a member of the [Plant Health Propagation Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plant-health-propagation-scheme) or the [Seed potato Classification Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-seed-potato-classification-scheme), you may not need a certificate. Contact APHA to find out.

$CTA

Apply by filling in the appropriate form for:

* [potatoes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515925/form-phe60.pdf)   
* other [plants, including fruit and vegetables](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515922/form-phe36.pdf)    
* plants from [outside the EU that were stored, repacked, or split up](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515946/form-hh87.pdf)

Return the completed form to [your local APHA office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate).

Your plants will be tested. If they pass, you’ll get your certificate in 7 days. It usually costs £13.87 for the plant health certificate and £36.35 for a lab inspection.

You can contact APHA to check whether you:

- need a soil inspection for the plants you're exporting - use the [soil inspection form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/potato-cyst-nematode-application-for-soil-sampling) if you do
-  need to wash soil from the roots of the plants you export - the USA, New Zealand and other countries require this

[Question for SME: Do you growing season inspections also apply to food?]
[Question for SME: Is eDomero available for these tasks? It is not mentioned in the current guidance]

If your soil needs to be tested, it costs £49.68 for every 15 minutes of inspection time. There's a minimum fee of £99.36.

[Question for SME: Does the inspection fee include a certificate or do you need pay a certificate fee on top of that?]

###Reduced fees for small businesses

You can [apply for a 50% discount](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515921/form-phe3.pdf) for the first £500 of APHA services in a financial year if both the following apply:

* you're not registered for VAT 
* your certified exports were worth less £5,000 in the last financial year

##Grain
{:#grain}

Check the table of countries for whether you need a [plant health certificate](#plant-health-certificate-grain) to export grain outside the EU.

The table also shows if you need:

- to send a sample for testing when you apply for your certificate
- an import permit - get this from the country you're exporting to

You don’t need a certificate or licence to export to countries that aren't in the table, or within the EU.

You apply a different way in [Scotland](https://www.sasa.gov.uk/plant-health/plant-health-licensing) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/contact).

###Apply for a plant health certificate for grain
{:#plant-health-certificate-grain}

s1. If you need one, apply for an import permit from the country you're exporting to.
s2. Fill in the [plant health certificate application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf) (PDF, 286KB). Only fill in sections 1 and 2 if you need to send a sample. 
s3. Return the form to [APHA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening#plant-health--seeds-inspectorate) 5 days before you want to export. 
s4. If required, include a 1kg sample when you return your application form. For Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, China or Vietnam, send a second 1 kg sample in a paper bag sealed inside a plastic bag.
s5. Contact the port you’re exporting from to arrange for a trade inspector to inspect your grain.
s6. When you've passed your inspection, fill in another copy of the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/515947/form-hh93.pdf).

[Question: What is the second application form in step 6 for? Where does the user have to send it?]

[Question for SME: Do users need to know about the country specific tests for Cuba and Vietnam or will the inspectors know what to test for according to the destination country?]

If you fail the inspection, you’ll need to have your grain treated by a professional company. This usually takes 10 to 20 days, but you may be able to get your grain treated in transit.

Sometimes you’ll also need a declaration to add to your plant certificate to prove you’ve tested for certain pests. This is required in:

* Hungary for acarus siro L  
* Vietnam for tilletia indica (karnal bunt) only  
* Kyrgyzstan for tilletia indica and Trogoderma granarium

[Question for SME: Do APHA provide these automatically? It’s not on the form]


###Fees

You must pay:

* £59.53 to get phytosanitary certificates
* £59.53 for a trade inspector to inspect your grain
* £59.53 to APHA, if you need to send a sample

Small exporters are eligible for a [discounted fee](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-export-services-application-for-concessionary-rates).
