##Register
{:#register}

You must register with the Rural Payments Agency before exporting food and agricultural products. Call 0300 020 0301 to register.
##Apply for a licence or certificate
{:#apply)

Fill in an [Export Licence Application Form (AGREX)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/299695/Exports_-_Electronic_Licence_Application_Form.doc) and send it to RPA:

$A

Customer Service Centre Rural Payments Agency 
PO Box 1058 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne 
NE99 7YQ

$A

You can also post, fax or email your application without using using an AGREX. If you’re not using an AGREX your application must contain:

- your full name, address and trader registration number
- where you’re sending the goods
- the trade description of the goods
- the combined nomenclature code of the goods
- how much security deposit you’re sending
- whether you need a certificate with advance fixing of your CAP refund - an Advanced Fixing Certificate or a World Trade Organization (WTO) licence
- whether you’re tendering for the supply of the product

If you want to email your application you must get RPA approval first. Fill in [form TS03](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/299696/TSO3_-_Email_licence_v3_May_08.doc) and post or fax it to RPA.

##Apply for a recipe code
{:#recipe}

You can apply for a recipe code if you’re exporting processed goods. This code allows you to claim a refund more simply by calculating the percentage of each eligible ingredient used in the processed goods as opposed to claiming each separate ingredient.

##Pay a security deposit
{:#security}


You may need to pay a security deposit. Find out how much you’ll need to pay the relevant [agricultural product guide](#agriculture-guides).

You won’t have to pay if the security is less than €100. Call the guarantees section of RPA if you’re not sure if you need to pay.

##After you’ve applied

RPA will give you either:

- a standard export licence
- an Advanced Fixing Certificate (also known as a WTO licence)

Find out how long it takes to get your certificate or licence in the relevant [agricultural product guide](#agriculture-guides).


##Claim a Common Agriculture Policy refund
{:#refund}

You can claim a CAP refund (or subsidy) when the market price of the goods you export is lower in your target market than in the EU. 

This allows you to competitively price your goods in your chosen export market without losing money.

###Eligibility

To claim a refund, you must prove your goods:

- were exported within 60 days of an [export declaration](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/overview.html) being accepted
- are of marketable quality [SME question: what does ‘marketable quality’ mean?]
- are in [free circulation](/link) in the EU
- have not been altered while in Customs control 
- are of EU origin
- were exported in suitable welfare conditions, if you’re transporting live animals

You must claim your refund within 12 months of exporting your goods.

####Changing transport 

If your goods enter another EU port to change their method of transport (transhipment) to qualify for a refund they must leave the port within both:

- the original 60 days of your export declaration being accepted
- 28 days of arriving at the EU port

###How to claim

To claim an export refund you must:

- [register as a trader with the Rural Payments Agency](/guidance/register-for-rural-payments)
- put your goods under Customs control
- prove that you’re eligible for the refund

####Put goods under Customs control

There are 3 ways to put your goods under customs control, either:

-  make an CAP export refund declaration online
- fill-in forms [C88 and C88(CAP)CIE](/government/publications/import-and-export-common-agricultural-policy-export-customs-input-of-entry-control-c88-cap-cie) - HMRC will then put the data into NES for you when your goods are at the border
- use [simplified scheduling procedures](#simplified-scheduling-procedure)

####Make an CAP export refund declaration online

Under Customs’ New Export System (NES) exporters and agents can [make an CAP export refund declaration online](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/overview.html). 

You’ll need to include in your declaration the:

- CAP licence references
- type and quantity of goods you’re exporting
- details about where they’re being exported to
- transport type you goods are going to be exported on
- proof of arrival if your goods are [differentiated](#differentiated-refunds)

You can list up to 99 items in each declaration. 


####Simplified scheduling procedure
{:#simplified-scheduling-procedure}

[SME question: What’s the benefit of doing simplified scheduling procedure? Is it less paperwork?]

You may be able to use the simplified scheduling procedure if you’re:

- an exporting victualling supplier for ships and aircraft in the EU
- supplying international organisations in the UK that are allowed to receive duty free goods
- supplying armed forces within the EU who aren’t in their home country
- providing catering supplies for oil or gas rigs on the EU shelf or naval vessels at sea flying a member state’s flag
- receiving regular, scheduled consignments of less than 5,000kg of cereal or 500kg of other goods per month

Contact the HMRC helpline to find out about getting approved to use the simplified scheduling procedure.

##How much you’ll receive

How much you’ll receive depends on whether it’s an ‘undifferentiated’ or ‘differentiated’ refund.


###Undifferentiated refunds

Undifferentiated refunds have a single rate of refund for each product regardless of where you’re exporting them to. You don’t have to provide a proof of arrival.

[SME question: how do you find out how much the single rate is?]

###Differentiated refunds
{:#differentiated-refunds}

Differentiated refunds have a different rate of refund for each product depending on what country you’re exporting them to. 

[SME question: how do you find out how much the different rates are?]

You must give the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) proof of export. You may also need to give RPA proof of import into the non-EU country.

##Request an advance refund payment

You can [request an advance refund payment](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374200/c1227a.pdf) once your goods have been put into Customs control. 

You must make a 110% deposit security on the refund you’re claiming. The deposit will be returned once you submit your proof of export.

[SME question: how do you make a deposit?]
