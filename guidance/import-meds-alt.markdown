##Licensed medicines

You can [search for UK-licensed medicines] using the MHRA database. There are different rules for importing [unlicensed medicines](#unlicensed-medicines).

s1. [Check if you need a manufacturer or wholesaler licence](#manufacturer-wholesale-licence), if you don’t have them already. Allow 90 working days if you need to apply.
s2. Follow the rules if the medicine contains a [controlled substance](#controlled-drugs).
s2. If you don’t hold the marketing authorisation for the medicine, tell the holder that you’re importing it (unless they asked you to source it). You can find their details by [searching for the medicine’s Summary of Product Characteristics](http://www.mhra.gov.uk/spc-pil/) (SPC).
s3. Check if the medicine has a [marketing authorisation from the European Medicines Agency](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/landing/epar_search.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124) (EMA). If it does, [tell EMA](http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/about_us/q_and_a/q_and_a_detail_000079.jsp&mid=) that you’re importing it.



###Check if you need a manufacturer or wholesaler licence
{:#manufacturer-wholesale-licence}

Which licence you need depends on where you're importing the medicines from and where you'll supply them.

If you’re importing from within the EEA:

- you need a wholesaler licence if you’ll supply medicines within the UK or another EEA country
- you don’t need a licence to supply countries outside the EEA

If you’re importing from outside the EEA, you need:

- a manufacturer licence if you’ll supply medicines within the UK or another EEA country
- a wholesaler licence If you’ll supply medicines outside the EEA

Read how to [apply for a manufacturer or wholesaler licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences). Allow 90 days to get the licence - you’ll need to pay a fee and have a site inspection.

##Unlicensed medicines

You may be able to import unlicensed medicine if both:

- a patient has a special clinical need for the medicine
- there isn't an appropriate licensed product available in the UK

s1. [Check if you need a wholesaler or manufacturer ‘specials’ licence], if you don’t have them already. Allow 90 working days if you need to apply - you’ll need to pay a fee.
s2. [Tell MHRA you plan to import unlicensed medicine](#tell-MHRA). Allow at least 28 days, unless it’s an emergency.
s3. MHRA will contact you if you’re not allowed to import the product, for example if there are concerns about the product’s safety or quality. 
s4. At the end of the financial year, you pay a [fee](#notification-fee) based on the number of imports you made.

If the medicine is not licensed in the EEA or Australia, Canada, New Zealand or Switzerland, make sure that any animal by-products it contains meet [TSE (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies) requirements](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tse-requirements-for-imported-unlicensed-human-medicines).

[Question for SME: Is there a list of TSE risk materials available we could link to?]
[How does someone get a EDQM certificate or conduct a risk assessment to prove each risk material is compliant?]


###Check if you need a manufacturer or wholesaler licence
{:#wholesale-specials-licence}

You need a wholesaler licence to import unlicensed medicines from within the EEA, or a manufacturer's ‘specials’ licence if you’re importing from outside the EEA.

Read how to [apply for a wholesaler or a ‘specials’ licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences). Allow 90 days to get the licence - you’ll need to pay a fee and have a site inspection.

###Tell MHRA that you plan to import unlicensed medicine
{:#tell-MHRA}

Fill in the [notification of intent form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473221/Notification_of_intent_to_import_-_application_form.xls) (XLS, 27KB) and email it 28 days before you import the product. The email address is on the form.

If the medicine is for a life-threatening illness, a significant injury or other clinical emergency, you can get permission within 1 working day. Call 020 3080 7002 (or 020 3080 6000 if the line is busy, or 07795 641532 out of hours).


###Fees
{:#notification-fee}

On top of the [cost of the wholesaler or specials licence](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-manufacturer-or-wholesaler-of-medicines-licences#fees-and-payment), you pay a fee based on the number of notifications you made in a year.

| Number of notifications | Fee     |
|-------------------------|---------|
| 1 to 20                 | £130     |
| 21 to 100               | £519     |
| 101 to 1,000            | £2,077   |
| 1,001 to 5,000          | £10,383  |
| 5,001 to 20,000         | £25,957  |
| 20,001 to 50,000        | £51,914  |
| 50,001 to 100,000       | £103,828 |
| 100,001+                | £155,742 |


You’ll get:

- an estimate based on a how many notifications MHRA think you’ll make, early in the year
- an invoice at the end of the financial year

[SME question - when is the financial year for this purpose? April?]
