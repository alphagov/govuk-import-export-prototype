##Precursor chemicals

You may need a licence or follow special rules to export ‘precursor chemicals’ or move them within the EU. 

Precursors are the chemicals that can be used to manufacture controlled drugs. The table shows precursors and their category - this affects what you need to do if you export them.

The rules for precursor chemicals also apply to products that include them unless:

- the product is for medicinal use by humans (but ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are exceptions that always need an export licence)
- the precursor chemical can’t be easily used or extracted 

You don’t need a licence or follow special rules to:

- move [small amounts] of category 2 chemicals within the EU
- move category 3 chemicals within the EU
- export [small quantities] of category 3 chemicals to [most countries outside the EU] 

Otherwise, you need to complete certain tasks.

s1. Get named applicants an [enhanced disclosure check](#dbs).
s2. Apply for a [precursor chemical licence].
s3. Get a [declaration from the end-user]. This isn’t required for category 2B chemicals.
s4. Apply for an export licence, if you’re exporting outside the EU. For category 2 or 3 chemicals, you only need a licence to export to certain countries.

If you export [small amounts] of category 3 chemicals to [certain countries] outside the EU, you only need an export licence. Don’t complete the other steps.

###Get an enhanced disclosure check

###Apply for a precursor chemicals licence
{:#apply-domestic-licence}

[Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/drugs_registration.ofml). 

Once you’ve registered, [log into your account](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/DrugsConsole.ofml  to apply for your precursor chemicals licence (category 1 chemicals only).

You should get a decision within 16 weeks. If you’re applying for the first time, your premises will be visited as part of your application.

####Fees

A new precursor licence for category 1 chemicals costs £3,655 and lasts for one year. The cost to renew is £326. 

The cost for registration for category 2 and 3 chemicals is £435.

[SME question: What can they do if they haven't got a decision after 16 weeks?

###End-user declaration
{:#end-user}

You must ask the person receiving the goods to give you a completed end-user declaration form.

Get them to fill in form for either:

- a single transaction (Excel, 23kb)
- multiple transactions (Excel, 23kb)

[Question for SME: What does the exporter do with this form? And what if the person they’re exporting to isn’t the end-user - do they still have to complete the form?]
