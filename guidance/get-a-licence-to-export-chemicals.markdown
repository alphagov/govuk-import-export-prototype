Within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea), there aren't special rules unless you export [controlled chemicals](#licences-controlled-chemicals), for example those with a military use.

Outside the EU, you must follow the [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules), as well the rules for any controlled chemicals.

Export rules cover single substances as well as mixtures (also called preparations). For example, paints, inks, glues or oils.

Some countries may have import rules for certain goods. You can check by talking to your importer or getting help [researching your export market](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti-experimental-sg.html).

##Licences for controlled chemicals
{:#licences-controlled-chemicals}

You may need a licence, including if you trade within the EU, for exports of:

- chemicals with [military or potential military uses](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html)
- [controlled drugs](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html) (eg morphine or certain insomnia medication), or chemicals that can be used to make them (‘[drug precursors](#precursors)’)
- [ozone-depleting substances](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-cfcs-and-ozone-depleting-gases.html), eg HCFCs
- [barbiturates](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#lethal-injections) that can be used in lethal injections
- [radioactive substances](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-radioactive-substances.html)

If you supply [chemicals that could be used to make explosives](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supplying-explosives-precursors/supplying-explosives-precursors-and-poison#regulated-substances) to a member of the public in the EU, you must check they have a licence and a photo ID.
You must report any suspicious transactions - [check the contact in the country you're exporting to](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/explosives/explosives-precursors/docs/list_of_competent_authorities_and_national_contact_points_en.pdf) (PDF, 478KB).

###Drug precursor chemicals
{:#precursors}

You may need a licence to export drug precursor chemicals. This is in addition to any [domestic licence](http://www.gov.uk/guidance/controlled-drugs-licences-fees-and-returns#applying-for-a-licence-companies) you need to possess the chemicals in the UK.

###Apply for an export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

[Check the table](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb) to confirm if your chemical needs an export licence (sometimes called a pre-export notification or “PEN”).

To apply, either:

- [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) with the National Drugs control System (NDS)
- [log in](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Login.aspx) if you’ve already registered

Apply at least 20 working days in advance. Your licence will be valid for 3 months.

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24 - an invoice will be sent to your address.

If you need a purchase order number on the invoice, state this when you apply or email <DFLU.fees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk>.

###Contact

Contact the Drugs and Firearms Licensing Unit (DFLU) if you need help with exporting precursor chemicals.

##Additional export rules for outside the EU
{:#additional-export-rules}

To export chemicals outside the EU, you must:

- pack and label them to [EU standards](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/index.htm)
- include a [safety data sheet](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/safety-data-sheets.htm) to each importer
- translate the label and safety data sheet into the language of the country you’re exporting to
- not export them within 6 months of their expiry date
- for restricted chemicals, [apply for a reference identification number](#restricted-chemicals) (RIN) 

###Get a RIN for restricted chemicals
{:#restricted-chemicals}

You need to include a reference identification number (RIN) in your customs declaration if either:

- the chemical is restricted - classed as ‘Annex 1’
f- you export 10kg or less of any non-restricted chemical for research or analysis

Search for Annex 1 chemicals using the [tool on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website](http://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/pic/chemicals). 

If your chemical is classed as Annex 1, note:

- which ‘parts’ of Annex 1 the chemical is in - there are more restrictions on chemicals in parts 2 and 3
- the CAS number

You'll need this information when you apply for a RIN. You do this by making an online notification.

$CTA

Chemicals classed as Annex 5 are banned and can’t be exported without an exemption. Contact HSE if you need help: UKDNA@hse.gov.uk.

[Question for SME: Who should someone contact to find out about exemptions?]

###Making an online notification

To get a RIN you need to make an online notification at least 30 days before you first export restricted chemicals. Allow 15 days for notifications you make after this.

Chemicals in parts 2 and 3 of Annex 1 may take longer or be refused because they must be authorised by the country you’re exporting to. 

You first need [an online account](https://epic.echa.europa.eu/pic-industry-web/index.xhtml). Email the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) at <UKDNA@hse.gov.uk> with the subject line ‘Edexim account request’. Include details of:

- the chemical you want to export and its CAS number
- your company - name, address, website and [Companies House number](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/), if it’s a limited company
- your preferred username - up to 16 characters (use letters, numbers and underscore only)

Once you’re registered, you can make your online notification. 

[Question for SME: What is the URL for online notifications? http://edexim.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ doesn’t seem to work.]

You can use the same RIN for all exports of the same chemical in the same calendar year. You don’t need to make another notification.

When transporting restricted chemicals, you’ll need to follow the rules for moving [dangerous goods](/guidance/moving-dangerous-goods).

###Annual reporting requirements

Every year you must tell HSE about the Annex 1 chemicals you’ve exported.

You can do this on your [online notification account]( You can do this using your online notification account.
).


###Products that contain highly restricted chemicals

You need a RIN number if you export a product that both:

- includes a chemical in part 2 or 3 of Annex 1
- is classed as an [article](http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/definitions.htm#article)

This includes products like cars, batteries or telephones.

You don’t need to follow the other [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules) for chemical substances and mixtures.

Contact HSE if you need help.
