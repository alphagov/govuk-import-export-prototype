Within the [EU](https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea), there aren't special rules unless you export [controlled chemicals](#licences-controlled-chemicals), eg those with a military use or controlled drugs.

Outside the EU, you must follow the [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules), as well the rules for any controlled chemicals.

Export rules cover single substances as well as mixtures (also called preparations), eg paints, inks, glues or oils.

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Licences for controlled chemicals
{:#licences-controlled-chemicals}

You may need a licence, including if you trade within the EU, for exports of:

- chemicals with [military or potential military uses](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html)
- [controlled drugs](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html) (eg morphine or cannabis), or chemicals that can be used to make them (‘[drug precursors](#precursors)’)
- [ozone-depleting substances](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-cfcs-and-ozone-depleting-gases.html), eg HCFCs
- [barbiturates](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#export-barbiturates) that can be used in lethal injections
- [radioactive substances](https://govuk-import-export.herokuapp.com/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-radioactive-substances.html)

If you supply [chemicals that could be used to make explosives](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supplying-explosives-precursors/supplying-explosives-precursors-and-poison#regulated-substances) to a member of the public in the EU, you must check they have a licence and a photo ID.
You must report any suspicious transactions - [check the contact in the country you're exporting to](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/explosives/explosives-precursors/docs/list_of_competent_authorities_and_national_contact_points_en.pdf) (PDF, 478KB).

###Drug precursor chemicals
{:#precursors}

You may need a licence or to follow special rules to export drug precursor chemicals. This includes moving them within the EU.

$CTA

[You must already have a domestic license](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/precursor-chemical-licensing) before you apply for an export licence.

$CTA

###Apply for an export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

[Check the table](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb) to confirm if your chemical needs:

* an export licence (“individual authorisation”) 
* a pre-export notification (“PEN”) - you won’t need to apply for anything else but your licence will take 15 days longer to be processed

To apply, either:

- [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) with the National Drugs control System (NDS)
- [log in](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Login.aspx) if you’ve already registered

Your licence will be valid for up to 3 months (or until your import permit expires, if sooner).

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24 - an invoice will be sent to your address.

If you need a purchase order number on the invoice, state this when you apply or email DFLU.fees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.

###Annual returns
{:#annual-returns-precursors}

You must tell the Home Office about the precursor drugs you export each year.

Complete the [annual return form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/275020/Precursor_chemicals_AR_form-2013.xlsx) (XLS, 151kb) and email it by 31 January to the address on the form.

[Question for SME: this from is from 2013 - is there an up-to-date version of the form available?]

###Contact

Contact Drug Licensing and Compliance Unit (DLCU) if you need help with exporting precursor chemicals.

##Additional export rules for outside the EU
{:#additional-export-rules}

To export chemicals outside the EU, you must:

- pack and label them to [EU standards](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/index.htm)
- include a [safety data sheet](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/safety-data-sheets.htm) to each importer
- translate the label and safety data sheet into the language of the country you’re exporting to
- not export them within 6 months of their expiry date
- for restricted chemicals, [apply for a reference identification number](#restricted-chemicals) (RIN) 

###Get a RIN for restricted chemicals
{:#restricted-chemicals}

You need to include a reference identification number (RIN) in your [export declaration](/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/) if either:

- the chemical is restricted - classed as ‘Annex 1’
- you export 10kg or less of any non-restricted chemical for research or analysis

Search for Annex 1 chemicals using the [tool on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website](http://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/pic/chemicals). 

If your chemical is classed as Annex 1, note:

- which ‘parts’ of Annex 1 the chemical is in - there are more restrictions on chemicals in parts 2 and 3
- the CAS number

You'll need this information when you apply for a RIN. You do this by making an online notification.

$CTA

Chemicals classed as Annex 5 are banned and can’t be exported without an exemption. Contact xxx.

$CTA

[Question for SME: Who should someone contact to find out about exemptions]

###Making an online notification

To get a RIN you need to make an online notification at least 30 days before you first export restricted chemicals. Allow 15 days for notifications you make after this.

Chemicals in parts 2 and 3 of Annex 1 may take longer or be refused because they must be authorised by the country you’re exporting to. 

You first need an online account. Email the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), including specific information.


**Health and Safety Executive**  
<UKDNA@hse.gov.uk>  

Using the subject line ‘Edexim account request’, tell HSE:

- the chemical you want to export and its CAS number
- your company details - name, address, website and [Companies House number](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/), if it’s a limited company
- your preferred username - up to 16 characters (use letters, numbers and underscore only)

Once you’re registered, you can make your online notification. 

[Question for SME: What is the URL for online notifications? http://edexim.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ doesn’t seem to work.]

You can use the same RIN for all exports of the same chemical in the same calendar year. You don’t need to make another notification.

When transporting restricted chemicals, you’ll need to follow the rules for moving [dangerous goods](/guidance/moving-dangerous-goods).


###If your company is registered outside the UK

Apply for a RIN from the  authority in the country you’re exporting to instead.


###Annual reporting requirements

Every year you must tell HSE about the Annex 1 chemicals you’ve exported.

Fill in the [annual return template](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pic/exporters/exporter-tonnage-return.xls) (XLS, 15kb) and email it to HSE by 31 March the year after.

[Question for SME: Which email address should someone use to return the form?]


###Products that contain highly restricted chemicals

You need a RIN number if you export a product that both:

- includes a chemical in part 2 or 3 of Annex 1
- is classed as an [article](http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/definitions.htm#article)

This includes products like cars, batteries or telephones.

You don’t need to follow the other [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules) for chemical substances and mixtures.

Contact HSE if you need help.
