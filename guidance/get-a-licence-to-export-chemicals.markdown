Within the EU, there aren't special rules unless you export [controlled chemicals](#licences-controlled-chemicals), eg those with a military use or controlled drugs.

Outside the EU, you must follow the rules for controlled chemicals as well as the [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules).

Export rules cover single substances as well as mixtures (also called preparations), eg paints, inks, glues or oils.

Also check the import rules of the country you’re exporting to. Talk to your importer or [get help with overseas customs rules](/answer/choosing-export-market-ukti.html).

##Licences for controlled chemicals
{:#licences-controlled-chemicals}

You may need a licence, including if you trade within the EU, for exports of:

- chemicals with [military or potential military uses](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-arms-military-or-dual-use-goods-and-services.html)
- [controlled drugs](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html) (eg morphine or cannabis), or chemicals that can be used to make them (‘[drug precursors](#precursors)’)
- [ozone-depleting substances](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-cfcs-and-ozone-depleting-gases.html), eg HCFCs
- [barbiturates](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-export-drugs-and-medicines.html#export-barbiturates) that can be used in lethal injections

If you supply [chemicals that could be used to make explosives](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supplying-explosives-precursors/supplying-explosives-precursors-and-poison#regulated-substances) to a member of the public in the EU, you must check they have a licence and a photo ID.
You must report any suspicious transactions - [check the contact in the country you're exporting to](http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/explosives/explosives-precursors/docs/list_of_competent_authorities_and_national_contact_points_en.pdf).

###Drug precursor chemicals
{:#precursors}

You may need a licence or to follow special rules to export drug precursor chemicals. This includes moving them within the EU.

Precursors are chemicals that can be used to manufacture controlled drugs. The table shows drug precursors and their category - this affects what you need to do to move or export them.

The rules for drug precursor chemicals also apply to products that include them unless:

- the product is for medicinal use by humans (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are exceptions to this that always need an export licence)
- the precursor chemical can’t be easily used or extracted 

###When you don't need a precursor licence

You don’t need a licence or follow special rules to:

- move of category 2 chemicals within the EU in [small amounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) (PDF, 17kb)
- move category 3 chemicals within the EU
- export of category 3 chemicals outside the EU in [small quantities](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) (PDF, 17kb), unless you're exporting to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb)

###Tasks you need to complete if you need a precursor licence

You need to complete these tasks.

s1. Get named applicants an [enhanced DBS check](#dbs).
s2. [Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System](#domestic-licence-registration). You also need to apply for a domestic licence for category 1 chemicals.
s3. Get a [declaration from the end-user](#end-user). This isn’t required for category 2B chemicals.
s4. [Apply for an export licence](#apply-export-licence), if you’re exporting outside the EU. 
s5. [Fill in an annual return](#annual-returns-precursors) by 31 January.

If you export category 3 chemicals in [small amounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) (PDF, 17kb)  outside the EU to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb), you only need an export licence. Don’t complete the other steps.




###Get an enhanced disclosure check
{:#dbs}

Each person named on your application must have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) enhanced disclosure check. 

Contact Security Watchdog to apply for a DBS enhanced disclosure.

###Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System
{:#domestic-licence-registration}

For all precursor chemicals, you must [register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System.](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/drugs_registration.ofml)

For category 1 chemicals only, you can then [log in to your account](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/DrugsConsole.ofml) to apply for a domestic licence for precursor chemicals.

You should get a decision about the domestic licence within 16 weeks. If you’re applying for the first time, your premises will be visited as part of your application.

[SME question: What can they do if they haven't got a decision after 16 weeks?

####Fees

A new precursor licence for category 1 chemicals costs £3,655 and lasts for one year. The cost to renew is £326. 

The cost for registration for category 2 and 3 chemicals is £435.

###End-user declaration
{:#end-user}

You must ask the person receiving the goods to give you a completed end-user declaration form.

Get them to fill in form for either:

- [a single transaction](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/98062/customer-dec-1-2-individual.xls) (Excel, 23kb)
- [multiple transactions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/98061/customer-dec-1-2-multiple.xls) (Excel, 23kb)

[Question for SME: What does the exporter do with this form? And what if the person they’re exporting to isn’t the end-user - do they still have to complete the form?]

###Apply for an export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

You need an export licence for:

- all category 1 chemicals
- category 2 or 3 chemicals you export to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb)

To apply, either:

- [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) with the National Drugs control System (NDS)
- [log in](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Login.aspx) if you’ve already registered

You’ll need:

- your [company number](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) for the notes field
- to submit a copy of the import permit from the country you’re exporting to - send the original to [the Drug Licensing and Compliance Unit](#contact-dlcu) (DLCU)

Your licence will be valid for up to 2 months (or until your import permit expires, if sooner).

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24. A replacement licence costs £45.

DLCU will send you a written invoice to the registered address on your customer account.

If you need a purchase order number on the invoice, state this when you apply or email [DLCUfees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk](DLCUCommsOfficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk).

###Annual returns
{:#annual-returns-precursors}

You must tell the Home Office about the precursor drugs you export each year.

Complete the [annual return form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/275020/Precursor_chemicals_AR_form-2013.xlsx) (XLS, 151kb) and email it by 31 January to the address on the form.

[Question for SME: this from is from 2013 - is there an up-to-date version of the form available?]

###Contact

##Additional export rules
{:#additional-export-rules}

To export chemicals outside the EU, you must:

- pack and label them to [EU standards](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/index.htm)
- include a [safety data sheet](http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/safety-data-sheets.htm) to each importer
- translate the label and safety data sheet into the language of the country you’re exporting to
- not export them within 6 months of their expiry date
- for restricted chemicals, [apply for a reference identification number](#restricted-chemicals) (RIN) 

###Get a RIN for restricted chemicals
{:#restricted-chemicals}

You need to include a reference identification number (RIN) in your [export declaration](/guide/declare-exporting-goods-from-eu/) if either:

- the chemical is restricted - classed as ‘Annex 1’
- you export 10kg or less of any non-restricted chemical for research or analysis

Search for Annex 1 chemicals using the [tool on the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) website](http://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/pic/chemicals). 

If your chemical is classed as Annex 1, note:

- which ‘parts’ of Annex 1 the chemical is in - there are more restrictions on chemicals in parts 2 and 3
- the CAS number

You'll need this information when you apply for a RIN. You do this by making an online notification.

$CTA

Chemicals classed as Annex 5 are banned and can’t be exported without an exemption. Contact xxx.

$CTA

[Question for SME: Who should someone contact to find out about exemptions]

###Making an online notification

To get a RIN you need to make an online notification at least 30 days before you first export restricted chemicals. Allow 15 days for notifications you make after this.

Chemicals in parts 2 and 3 of Annex 1 may take longer or be refused because they must be authorised by the country you’re exporting to. 

You first need an online account. Email the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), including specific information.


**Health and Safety Executive**  
<UKDNA@hse.gov.uk>  

Using the subject line ‘Edexim account request’, tell HSE:

- the chemical you want to export and its CAS number
- your company details - name, address, website and [Companies House number](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/), if it’s a limited company
- your preferred username - up to 16 characters (use letters, numbers and underscore only)

Once you’re registered, you can make your online notification. 

[Question for SME: What is the URL for online notifications? http://edexim.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ doesn’t seem to work.]

You can use the same RIN for all exports of the same chemical in the same calendar year. You don’t need to make another notification.

When transporting restricted chemicals, you’ll need to follow the rules for moving [dangerous goods](/guidance/moving-dangerous-goods).


###If your company is registered outside the UK

Apply for a RIN from the  authority in the country you’re exporting to instead.


###Annual reporting requirements

Every year you must tell HSE about the Annex 1 chemicals you’ve exported.

Fill in the [annual return template](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pic/exporters/exporter-tonnage-return.xls) (XLS, 15kb) and email it to HSE by 31 March the year after.

[Question for SME: Which email address should someone use to return the form?]


###Products that contain highly restricted chemicals

You need a RIN number if you export a product that both:

- includes a chemical in part 2 or 3 of Annex 1
- is classed as an [article](http://www.hse.gov.uk/reach/definitions.htm#article)

This includes products like cars, batteries or telephones.

You don’t need to follow the other [additional export rules](#additional-export-rules) for chemical substances and mixtures.

Contact HSE if you need help.
