##Precursor chemicals

You may need a licence or follow special rules to export ‘precursor chemicals’ or move them within the EU. 

Precursors are  chemicals that can be used to manufacture controlled drugs. The table shows precursors and their category - this affects what you need to do to move or export them.


| Precursor                                   | Category |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1-phenyl-2-propanone (BMK)                  | 1        |

The rules for precursor chemicals also apply to products that include them unless:

- the product is for medicinal use by humans (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are exceptions to this that always need an export licence)
- the precursor chemical can’t be easily used or extracted 

###Tasks you need to complete

You don’t need a licence or follow special rules to:

- move [small amounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) (PDF, 17kb) of category 2 chemicals within the EU
- move category 3 chemicals within the EU
- export [small quantities](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) (PDF, 17kb) of category 3 chemicals outside the EU, unless you're exporting to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb)

Otherwise, you need to complete these tasks.

s1. Get named applicants an [enhanced DBS check](#dbs).
s2. [Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System](#domestic-licence-registration). You also need to apply a licence for category 1 chemicals.
s3. Get a [declaration from the end-user](#end-user). This isn’t required for category 2B chemicals.
s4. [Apply for an export licence](#apply-export-licence), if you’re exporting outside the EU. For category 2 or 3 chemicals, you only need a licence to export to certain countries.

If you export [small amounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523889/5_-_Precursor_Wallchart_-_Domestic-_May_2016.pdf) of category 3 chemicals to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb) outside the EU, you only need an export licence. Don’t complete the other steps.

###Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System
{:#domestic-licence-registration}

[Register with the Controlled Drugs Licensing System.](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/drugs_registration.ofml)

For category 1 chemicals, you can then [log in to your account](https://eforms.homeoffice.gov.uk/outreach/DrugsConsole.ofml) to apply for a precursor chemicals licence.

You should get a decision about the licence within 16 weeks. If you’re applying for the first time, your premises will be visited as part of your application.

[SME question: What can they do if they haven't got a decision after 16 weeks?

####Fees

A new precursor licence for category 1 chemicals costs £3,655 and lasts for one year. The cost to renew is £326. 

The cost for registration for category 2 and 3 chemicals is £435.

###End-user declaration
{:#end-user}

You must ask the person receiving the goods to give you a completed end-user declaration form.

Get them to fill in form for either:

- [a single transaction](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/98062/customer-dec-1-2-individual.xls) (Excel, 23kb)
- [multiple transactions](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/98061/customer-dec-1-2-multiple.xls) (Excel, 23kb)

[Question for SME: What does the exporter do with this form? And what if the person they’re exporting to isn’t the end-user - do they still have to complete the form?]

###Apply for an export licence
{:#apply-export-licence}

You need an export licence for:

- all category 1 chemicals
- category 2 or 3 chemicals you export to [certain countries](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523144/4_-_Precursor_Chemical_import_and_export_wallchart__v02-2016_.pdf) (PDF, 69kb)

To apply, either:

- [register for an account](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/UserRegForm.aspx) with the National Drugs control System (NDS)
- [log in](https://dlcu.homeoffice.gov.uk/Login.aspx) if you’ve already registered

You’ll need:

- your [company number](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) for the notes field
- to submit a copy of the import permit from the country you’re exporting to - send the original to [the Drug Licensing and Compliance Unit](#contact-dlcu) (DLCU)

Your licence will be valid for up to 2 months (or until your import permit expires, if sooner).

#####Fees

The export licence costs £24. A replacement licence costs £45.

DLCU will send you a written invoice to the registered address on your customer account.

If you need a purchase order number on the invoice, state this when you apply or email [DLCUfees@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk](DLCUCommsOfficer@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk).
