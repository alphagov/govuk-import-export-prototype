You must keep records of your customs declarations if you export goods outside of the EU.

You can buy reports that summarise your declarations to help with your record keeping responsibilities.

You can either order:

- a standard report
- a bespoke report

##Standard reports

You can order reports:

- to be sent to you every month
- showing historical information from up to 4 years ago

To order, fill in the [application form](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381489/Agreement_for_the_Sale_of_Management_Support_System__MSS__Data.pdf) (PDF, 111KB) and return it to the address on the form.

Reports cost £20 plus VAT for each month covered. You’ll get the reports by email, as a spreadsheet.

###Order a free sample
You can get a free month’s sample data if you want to check that a standard report covers what you need. Write to the Management Support System (MSS) team on company stationery, including:

- your business name and address
- EORI number
- email address where you want the report sent
- whether you want information on imports, exports or both
- the signature of a director, partner or owner of your business
