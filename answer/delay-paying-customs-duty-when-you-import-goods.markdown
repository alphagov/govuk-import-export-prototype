If you import goods regularly, you can apply for a duty deferment account to delay paying most customs charges. For example:

- customs duty
- excise duty
- import VAT
- Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) levies

It lets you make one payment per month through Direct Debit instead of paying for individual consignments.

You can apply for a duty deferment account if you’re an importer or an agent who represents importers.

## Apply for a duty deferment account

s1. Ask your bank, building society or insurance company to guarantee your duty payments by completing form C1201. They can get copies from the VAT, excise and customs helpline.
s2. [Apply for a duty deferment account](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/C1200&template=C1200.xdp).
