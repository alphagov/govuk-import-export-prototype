If you import goods regularly, you can apply for a duty deferment account to delay paying most customs charges. For example:

- customs duty
- excise duty
- import VAT
- Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) levies

It lets you make one payment per month through Direct Debit instead of paying for individual consignments.

You can apply for a duty deferment account if you’re an importer or an agent who represents importers.

## Apply for a duty deferment account

s1. Ask your bank, building society or insurance company to guarantee your duty payments by completing form C1201. They can get copies from the VAT, excise and customs helpline.
s2. [Apply for a duty deferment account](https://public-online.hmrc.gov.uk/lc/content/xfaforms/profiles/forms.html?contentRoot=repository:///Applications/Customs_A/1.0/C1200&template=C1200.xdp).

##Financial guarantees and Simplified Import VAT Accounting (SIVA)

When you have a duty deferment account, you can use the Simplified Import VAT Accounting (SIVA) scheme to reduce the financial guarantee that HMRC needs.

You only have to guarantee customs and excise duties if you have SIVA approval. Your guarantee will only have to cover the amount of duties you defer.

You’ll be able to defer the VAT and CAP levies without having to provide any security.

###Who can apply for SIVA

To get SIVA approval you must:

- be VAT registered
- have a duty deferment agreement with HMRC
- have been registered for VAT for at least 3 years
- have a good history of VAT compliance
- be up-to-date with what you owe HMRC without defaults in the past 12 months
- not have been charged with a serious offence by HMRC

Your business must not be in:

- administration
- liquidation
- insolvency
- receivership
- other financial difficulties

HMRC may need to see your last 2 years audited accounts and ask for a credit check on your business.

###How to apply

Fill [form SIVA 1](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/372662/siva1.pdf) to apply. Agents can also apply for SIVA on behalf of your business.

If your business has more than one Deferment Account Number you must apply for SIVA on each account. 

HMRC will send you a decision within 30 days. You must maintain a guarantee to cover import, excise duties and import VAT until you’re approved.
