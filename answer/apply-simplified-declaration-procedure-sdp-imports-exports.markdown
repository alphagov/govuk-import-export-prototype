{% contentfor summary %}

If you're a regular importer or exporter, the Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) lets you:

- delay making a full declaration when you import or export goods  
- import goods into a [customs warehouse](/guide/processing-under-customs-control-relief-customs-warehousing/overview.html) without making a declaration

It also makes it cheaper to [delay paying duty](/delay-paying-customs-duty-when-you-import-goods.html) on your goods.  

{% endcontentfor %}

You can apply to use SDP if you’re an importer, exporter, freight forwarder or agent who represents importers or exporters.

You can’t use SDP for hydrocarbon oils.

###Entry in the Declarants Records (EIDR) for importers

Apply to use Entry in the Declarants Records (EIDR) instead of SDP if you’re importing goods that you’re not planning to sell on directly. For example, you’re using them as raw materials to make something else.

EIDR lets you move the goods to your own premises or a storage facility while you carry out the import declaration. 

You can’t use EIDR for goods that need an import licence or certificate. For example:

- fresh food
- live animals
- motor and heating fuel
- weapons
- fireworks
- controlled drugs
- drug precursor chemicals
- rough diamonds

You can’t use EIDR for hydrocarbon oils.

##Apply to use SDP or EIDR

s1. You’ll need an EORI (Economic Operator Registration and Identification) number. You can [apply for an EORI number as a VAT registered businesses](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [apply for an EORI number as a business that isn’t registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport).
s2. You’ll need a [duty deferment account](link to content on duty deferment) with HM Revenue & Customs.
s3. Complete [form C&E48](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374170/ce48.pdf) (PDF,149KB) to apply to for SDP or EIDR.

You can [check whether your business already has an EORI number](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en) if you’re not sure.

##Bring goods into the UK temporarily

There’s a different process if you want to [bring goods into the UK temporarily](link to temporary imports content) (eg as samples to show your customers). You can’t use SDP or EIDR.
