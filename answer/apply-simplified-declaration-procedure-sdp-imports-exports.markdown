{% contentfor summary %}

Regular importers or exporters can apply to make simpler declarations.

{% endcontentfor %}

Apply for Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) to:

- delay making a full declaration when you import or export goods  
- import goods into a [customs warehouse](/guide/duty-relief-import-goods-processing/overview.html) without making a declaration
- make it cheaper to [delay paying duty](/delay-paying-customs-duty-when-you-import-goods.html) on your goods.  

##If you’re importing goods you won’t sell directly

Apply for Entry in the Declarants Records (EIDR) instead if you’re importing goods you won’t sell directly (eg raw materials you'll make into something else). 

EIDR lets you move the goods to your own premises or a storage facility while you carry out the import declaration. 

You can’t use it for [goods that require an import license](/guide/starting-to-import/import-licences.html) or certificate, eg weapons, fireworks or fresh foods.

##Apply to use SDP or EIDR

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. You’ll need a [duty deferment account](link to content on duty deferment) with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
s3. Complete [form C&E48](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374170/ce48.pdf) (PDF,149KB) to apply for SDP or EIDR.

You can [check if your business already has an EORI number.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en)

^Hydrocarbon oil exporters can't use these schemes.

##Bring goods into the UK temporarily
There’s a different process to bring goods into the UK temporarily (eg as samples to show your customers). You can’t use SDP or EIDR.
