{% contentfor summary %}

If you make import or export declarations regularly, the Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP):

- lets you make simplified declarations so you can move your goods faster
- makes it cheaper to [delay paying duty](link to duty deferral content) on your goods

{% endcontentfor %}

You can apply to use SDP if you’re an importer, exporter, freight forwarder or agent who represents importers or exporters.

You can’t use SDP for hydrocarbon oils.

### Local Clearance Procedure (LCP)

Apply to use the Local Clearance Procedure (LCP) instead of SDP if you’re importing goods that you’re not planning to sell on directly. For example, you’re using them as raw materials to make something else.

LCP lets you move the goods to your own premises or a storage facility while you carry out the import declaration. 

You can’t use LCP for goods that need an import licence or certificate. For example:

- fresh food
- live animals
- motor and heating fuel
- weapons
- fireworks
- controlled drugs
- drug precursor chemicals
- rough diamonds

You can’t use LCP for hydrocarbon oils.

## Apply to use SDP or LCP

You can [apply for an EORI number as a VAT registered businesses](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [apply for an EORI number as a business that isn’t registered for VAT]https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)).

s2. You’ll need a [duty deferment account](link to content on duty deferment) with HM Revenue & Customs.

s3. Complete [form C&E48](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/374170/ce48.pdf) (PDF,149KB) to apply to for SDP or LCP.

You can [check whether your business already has an EORI number]((http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en) if you’re not sure.

## Bring goods into the UK temporarily

There’s a different process if you want to [bring goods into the UK temporarily](link to temporary imports content) (eg as samples to show your customers). You can’t use SDP or LCP.
