{% contentfor summary %}

You can apply for Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status to:

- reduce the chances of your goods getting stopped at customs
- pay less for your [duty deferment guarantee](link to duty deferment content)

[Question for the SME: If you don’t have a duty deferment guarantee, is it still worth it? If not we need to add this to list of things to need to check before applying]

{% endcontentfor %}

Anyone involved in moving goods internationally can apply, eg importers, exporters, freight forwarders and customs warehouse keepers.

Your AEO status will be recognised by all EU countries and some countries outside the EU including:

* the USA
* Japan 
* China.
