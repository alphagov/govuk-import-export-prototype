Regular importers and exporters can apply for Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status to:

- reduce the chances of goods getting stopped at customs
- pay less for [duty deferment guarantee](link to duty deferment content)

[Question for SME: If you don’t have a duty deferment guarantee, is it still worth it? If not we need to add this to list of things to need to check before applying]

AEO status is recognised throughout the [EU](/eu-eea) and in the USA, Japan, China and some other countries.

##How to apply

You need to do 2 things before you apply.

s1. Check that you meet the [requirements for being an AEO](/government/publications/notice-117-authorised-economic-operator). You’ll need to show that you have ways to stop people tampering with your goods, eg a container in transit.
s2. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)

^You can [check if your business already has an EORI number.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en)

You’ll need the [notes on form C117](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/412612/C117-notes.pdf) (PDF, 90KB).
