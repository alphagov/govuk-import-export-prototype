{% contentfor summary %}

Use a [Standard Shipping Note](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/442288/standard_shipping_note.pdf) (PDF, 23.1KB) (SSN) to transport goods overseas.

You must use the SSN to give carriers and customs officials information about the goods and the companies involved in sending, shipping and receiving them.

You must fill in a separate SSN for each shipment you make and send it to your shipping company or freight forwarder.

^You can use a [freight forwarder](http://www.bifa.org/members) to help you ship goods internationally.^

##Export Cargo Shipping Instruction

An Export Cargo Shipping Instruction (ECSI) gives your carrier detailed instructions about how to handle your goods.

You don’t have to use one but it will help to settle any disputes with your carrier eg about cargo handling, documentation or export charges.

Ask your carrier or freight forwarder for a blank form. When you fill it in, include:

- a description of the goods
- the route
- any special transport requirements
- customs information
- who should receive the transport documents

^If your [goods are dangerous](/link-new-content) there are extra rules you need to follow.^

##Transporting goods by road

When you transport goods by road internationally, you must use a CMR note, which is a contract between you and the carrier.

You’ll need 4 copies of the CMR note:

- for the receiver (or customer)
- for the supplier
- to travel with the goods
- for your records

###Filling in the CMR note

You can buy pre-printed pads of CMR notes from [Road Haulage Association](http://www.rhaonline.co.uk/shop.php) (RHA) and the [Freight Transport Association (FTA).](http://www.shop.fta.co.uk/p-194-cmr-consignment-notes.aspx)

The note must contain information about:

- the sender, the carrier and the company or person who will receive the goods
- the goods and how they’ve been packaged
- the total weight of the cargo
- any costs, eg carrier fees that may get charged
