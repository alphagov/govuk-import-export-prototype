{% contentfor summary %}

You must fill in:

- a [Standard Shipping Note](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/442288/standard_shipping_note.pdf) (PDF, 23.1KB) for each consignment
- a CMR note -  if you transport goods by road outside the UK

{% endcontentfor %}

Give the notes to your agent, shipping company or freight forwarder.

You can also fill in an Export Cargo Shipping Instruction (ECSI) to tell your carrier how to handle your goods.

^There are extra rules when you [transport dangerous goods].

##CMR note  

You must fill in a CMR note when you transport goods by road outside the UK.

You can buy pre-printed pads of CMR notes from [Road Haulage Association](http://www.rhaonline.co.uk/search/index.php?search=CMR&type=products&form_submit=true&save=1&imageField.x=0&imageField.y=0) (RHA) and the [Freight Transport Association (FTA).](http://www.shop.fta.co.uk/p-194-cmr-consignment-notes.aspx)

You’ll need 4 copies of the CMR note:

- for the receiver (or customer)
- for the supplier
- to travel with the goods
- for your records

###If you don't use a pre-printed pad

You must include information about:

- the sender, the carrier and the company or person who will receive the goods
- the goods and how they’ve been packaged
- the total weight of the cargo
- any costs, eg carrier fees that may get charged

##ECSI

An ECSI can help settle any disputes with your carrier, eg about cargo handling, documentation or export charges.

Ask your carrier or freight forwarder for a blank form. When you fill it in, include:

- a description of the goods
- the route
- any special transport requirements
- customs information
- who should receive the transport documents
