You must declare goods that you take with you to sell outside the EU - for example if they're in your baggage or in a private vehicle.

The same rule applies to:

* Finland’s Aland Islands
* Spain’s Canary Islands
* the UK’s Channel Islands
* the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe
* French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion
* Mount Athos in Greece

You won’t need to do anything if your merchandise is being sold within the EU.

^There are different rules if you’re temporarily exporting trade samples, or professional equipment you’re not going to sell like a laptop [link to exporting goods temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html)^

##Make a declaration through form C88

[Contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries) to request a C88 form for merchanise in baggage.

[Question for SME: Is the short form available online?]

You’ll have to fill in more information on the form if your goods:

* have a total value of over £750
* weigh more than 1000kg 
* aren’t subject to export duty or [restricted] 

Ask the helpline to send you notes on completing the form if you've not used it before.

###What to do with your form

Bring the completed form with you when you transport your goods - if your goods require a licence, you should also carry it with you.

Arrive at the airport or port around 2 hours early to submit your form.
