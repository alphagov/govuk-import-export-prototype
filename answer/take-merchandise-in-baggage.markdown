You must declare goods that you take with you to sell outside the EU - for example if they're in your baggage or in a private vehicle.

The same rule applies to the following EU special territories:

- Åland Islands (Finland)   
- the Canary Islands
- the Channel Islands
- Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion
- Mount Athos, also known as Agion Poros (Greece)  

Within the EU, you don't need to declare your goods.

^There are different rules if you [take goods abroad temporarily] (for example samples for a trade fair) or if you [export using a courier or freight forwarder](/guide/starting-to-export/overview.html).

##Make a declaration

[Contact HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries) to request a C88 form for 'merchanise in baggage'.

[Question for SME: Is the short form available online?]

You’ll have to fill in more information if any of the following apply to your goods:

* have a total value of over £750
* weigh more than 1000kg 
* are subject to export duty or are [restricted](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html)

Ask the helpline to send you notes on completing the form if you've not used it before.

###What to do with your form

Bring the completed form with you when you transport your goods - if your goods require a licence, you should also carry it with you.

Arrive at the airport or port around 2 hours early to submit your form.
