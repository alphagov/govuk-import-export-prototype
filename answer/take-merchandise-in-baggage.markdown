You must declare goods that you take with you to sell outside the [EU](/eu-eea) - for example if they're in your baggage or in a private vehicle.

The same rule applies to the following EU special territories:

- Ã…land Islands (Finland)   
- the Canary Islands
- the Channel Islands
- Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique and Reunion
- Mount Athos, also known as Agion Poros (Greece)  

Within the EU, you don't need to declare your goods.

^There are different rules if you:

- take your goods to another EU country
- [take goods abroad temporarily](/guide/take-goods-out-uk-temporarily-for-business/overview.html) (for example samples for a trade fair)
- [use a courier or freight forwarder](/guide/starting-to-export/overview.html).

##Making a declaration

Arrive at the airport or port at least 2 hours early to make your declaration. If your goods require a [licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html), carry it with you.

You must present your goods and export declaration to the export officer at the port of departure.
