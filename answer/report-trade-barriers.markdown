Trade barriers make imported goods and services less competitive than those produced locally. 

You can report a trade barrier to the Market Access Unit (MAU), if you come across any of the following when selling outside the EU:

- tariffs and taxes imposed to protect, or favour, local producers
- unfair use of state help or subsidies
- labelling rules or burdensome customs procedures
- restrictive government procurement rules and practices
- technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures that arenâ€™t in line with the [Technical Barriers to Trade](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_e.htm) (TBT Agreement)
- poor protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indicators
- misuse of sanitary and phytosanitary measures
- restrictions on access to raw materials
- barriers to trade in services and investment, such as unjustified foreign ownership caps, joint venture obligations and discriminatory treatment

##What happens next

The MAU will deal with the trade barrier through:

- consultation and coordination with other government departments and agencies
