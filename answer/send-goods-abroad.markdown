What you need to good to send goods abroad by post or courier depends on whether you're sending goods:

- outside the [European Union](/eu-eea) (EU)
- you've sold

##Send anything outside the EU

You must attach a customs declaration to anything you send outside the EU (including gifts). 

If you use a courier, they’ll make the customs declaration for you.

Value of goods sent outside the EU | Customs declaration form 
- | - 
Up to £270 | Form CN22 (available from the Post Office) 
£270 to £2,000 | Form CN23 (available from the Post Office) 
Over £2,000 or when claiming customs relief | [Contact the Excise and Customs Helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries) for a copy of form C88. Take this to the Post Office and they'll enter the details onto the export declaration system.


##Send goods you've sold

Check if you need a  [licence](/guide/starting-to-export/export-licences.html) to send the goods.  

^If you don’t get a licence when you need one, you could be fined and your goods will be seized by customs.^ 

If you send goods that need an export licence, you must attach the following to your package: 

- an export licence
- a commercial invoice
- a C&E 83A sticky label from the Post Office

##Tax and customs charges

You won’t usually pay UK duty on exports, but you may have to pay taxes in the destination country.

You can [zero-rate](/vat-businesses/vat-rates)  the VAT on most goods you export to non-EU countries.

##If you send goods abroad regularly 

If you want to expand your exporting business, you can get help [choosing where to export](/start/choosing-export-market-ukti.html) and [finding overseas business opportunities](/start/find-overseas-business-opportunities.html).
