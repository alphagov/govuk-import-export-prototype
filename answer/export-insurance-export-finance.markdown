UK Export Finance (UKEF) helps UK exporters to: 

- win export contracts by providing better financing terms to your buyers
- fulfil orders by supporting working capital loans, for example by helping you buy new machinery
- get insurance to cover you if you don't get paid

^UKEF can't help to insure exports to EU countries (except Greece), Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the USA.
