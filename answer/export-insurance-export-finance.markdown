{% contentfor summary %}

You can get help from UK Export Finance (UKEF) to get:

- insurance to cover you if you don’t get paid when you export (when you can’t get insurance privately)
- a bond or loan to win a new export contract
- credit or a loan for overseas companies to buy from you

{% endcontentfor %}

^UKEF can't help to insure exports to EU countries (except Greece), Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the USA.
