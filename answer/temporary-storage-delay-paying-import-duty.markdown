You usually pay import duty and import VAT when you import goods from outside the EU or EEA.

But you can delay payment if you put the goods into an approved Temporary Storage facility (sometimes called ‘transit sheds’).

Temporary Storage lets you delay payment for:

- up to 20 days for goods imported by road or air
- up to 45 days for goods imported by sea

Search online to find an approved Temporary Storage facility near the port or airport you’re using. Or ask your freight forwarder or import agent.

## Putting goods into Temporary Storage

When you put goods into Temporary Storage, you must make a Temporary Storage [import declaration](/guide/import-goods-outside-eu/overview.html) as soon as possible.

[Question for SME: is that right - ie do you use the same mechanisms to make temporary storage declarations and full import declarations?]

Then when you’re ready to take the goods out of Temporary Storage, you make a full import declaration and pay the import duty and import VAT.

Some types of goods must have special checks carried out at customs. For example: 

- [fresh produce](guidance/get-a-licence-to-import-food-and-agricultural-products.html)
- [live animals](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-import-live-animals.html)
- [animal products](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-import-furs-skins-and-other-animal-products.html)
- [live plants](/guidance/get-a-licence-to-import-plants-or-plant-products.html)

You can’t put goods into Temporary Storage until these checks have been carried out. 

## What you can do with goods in Temporary Storage

You can’t unpack goods while they’re in Temporary Storage. You can only handle them if it’s necessary to preserve the goods.

If you want to move the goods to another approved Temporary Storage facility, you must make a [community transit declaration](/guide/move-goods-eu/when-to-make-declaration.html).
