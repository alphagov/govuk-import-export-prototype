Importing goods into the EU at a substantially low price is known as ‘dumping’.

If you observe dumping and think it’s damaging your market, you can report it to the European Community (EC).

You must show that at least 25% of EU production is affected. You’ll usually need the help of your [trade association](https://www.ukecc-services.net/ukpbata.cfm) to prove this. 

Contact your trade association or the EC Trade Defence Helpdesk for advice on starting a complaint.
