Read [the Department of International Trade (DIT) country guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exporting-country-guides) for an overview of:

- economic and industry information
- local legal requirements
- how to protect your intellectual property
- language and cultural issues

Read the [Overseas Business Risk reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/overseas-business-risk) for information on political instability, terrorism, crime, corruption, human rights issues and intellectual property risks. 

You can check the EU Market Access Database to research a country's [duty rates](http://madb.europa.eu/madb/datasetPreviewFormIFpubli.htm?datacat_id=IF&from=publi) and [licensing rules.](http://madb.europa.eu/madb/datasetPreviewFormATpubli.htm?datacat_id=AT&from=publi)

Check whether [EU wide technical rules or national rules](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors_en) apply if you're sending goods within the EU. If technical rules or national rules apply, you can get advice from the [product contact point](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors/mutual-recognition/contacts-list_en) for that country.
