{% contentfor intro %}

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor more_information %}

## If you’re not sure how to classify your goods

Read the [product classification guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/classification-of-goods) to help you find the correct commodity code.

You can [get advice from the classification service](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447050/CIP_27_Tariff_Classification_Change_of_Service_Delivery.pdf#page=3) (PDF, 159KB).

##If your goods aren’t listed in the Trade Tariff

Apply for a classification ruling through the Electronic Binding Tariff Information (eBTI) service.

Rulings:

- give certainty about the correct tariff classification for your goods
- are legally binding throughout the EU, usually for 6 years
- are free, but you may have to pay costs (for example, for laboratory analysis or expert advice)

###Using the eBTI service

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're registered for VAT or not registered for VAT.

s2. Sign up to use eBTI on the Government Gateway website.

s3. Sign in to eBTI.

^You can check if your business already has an EORI number.
