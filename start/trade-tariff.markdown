{% contentfor intro %}

Use the Trade Tariff to search for commodity codes.

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

The Trade Tariff classification service is free. Advice isn’t legally binding.

## Get a legally binding classification if your goods aren’t listed in the trade tariff

You can apply for a legally binding classification ruling through the [Electronic Binding Tariff Information (eBTI) service](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html).

Classification rulings are binding throughout the EU, usually for 6 years.

Classification rulings are free, but you may have to pay costs (eg to cover the costs of laboratory analysis or getting expert advice).

### Get set up to use the eBTI service

[Check if your business already has an EORI number]((http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en).
