{% contentfor intro %}

Use the Trade Tariff to search for commodity codes.

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor more_information %}

## If you’re not sure how to classify your goods

You'll usually need to search or browse by the main material your goods are made from.

You can get advice from the Trade Tariff classification service by filling in the [enquiry form.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447050/CIP_27_Tariff_Classification_Change_of_Service_Delivery.pdf#page=3)

## If your goods aren’t listed in the Trade Tariff

Apply for a classification ruling through the Electronic Binding Tariff Information (eBTI) service.

Rulings are:

- legally binding throughout the EU, usually for 6 years

- free, but you may have to pay costs (eg for laboratory analysis or expert advice)

###Using the eBTI service    


s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Sign up to use eBTI on the [Government Gateway website.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/)
s3. [Sign in](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html) to eBTI.

^You can [check if your business already has an EORI number.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/eori_validation.jsp?Lang=en)
