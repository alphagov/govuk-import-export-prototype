{% contentfor intro %}

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor more_information %}

## If you’re not sure how to classify your goods

Read the [product classification guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/classification-of-goods) to help you find the correct commodity code.

###Getting advice

You can get advice on how to classify your goods by emailing <classification.enquiries@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk>.

Include information about:

- what the product is
- what it’s made of (if made or more than one material please explain the breakdown of the materials
- what it’s used for
- how the product works or functions
- how it’s presented or packaged

You need to give more detail for [footwear, food, chemicals, textiles and vehicles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-600-classifying-your-imports-or-exports/notice-600-classifying-your-imports-or-exports#list-of-useful-contacts).

If you need advice about more than one product, send a separate email.

###Apply for a classification ruling

You can apply for a Binding Tariff Information (BTI) ruling to give certainty about the correct classification and how much duty you'll need to pay when importing your goods into the EU.

BTIs are:

- legally binding throughout the EU for 3 years
- free, but you may have to pay costs (for example, for laboratory analysis or expert advice)

You apply for a ruling using the eBTI online service.

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Sign up to use eBTI on the [Government Gateway website.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/)
s3. [Sign in to eBTI.](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html)
