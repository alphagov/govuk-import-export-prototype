{% contentfor intro %}

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor more_information %}

## If you’re not sure how to classify your goods

Read the [product classification guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/classification-of-goods) to help you find the correct commodity code.

You can [get advice from the classification service](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/447050/CIP_27_Tariff_Classification_Change_of_Service_Delivery.pdf#page=3) (PDF, 159KB).

###Apply for a classification 

You can apply for a classification ruling to give certainty about the correct tariff classification for your goods.

Rulings are:

- legally binding throughout the EU, usually for 3 years
- free, but you may have to pay costs (for example, for laboratory analysis or expert advice)

You apply for a ruling by using the eBTI service.

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or [not registered for VAT.](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATExport)
s2. Sign up to use eBTI on the [Government Gateway website.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/)
s3. [Sign in to eBTI.](https://secure.hmce.gov.uk/ecom/login/index.html)
