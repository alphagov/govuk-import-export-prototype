{% contentfor intro %}

Commodity codes classify goods for import and export so you can:

* fill in declarations and other paperwork
* check if there’s duty or VAT to pay
* find out about duty reliefs

{% endcontentfor %}

{% contentfor more_information %}

## If you’re not sure how to classify your goods

Read the [product classification guides](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/classification-of-goods) to help you find the correct commodity code.

###Getting advice

You can get advice on how to classify your goods by emailing <classification.enquiries@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk>.

Include information about your product - what it's made from, its use and function, and how it's presented or packaged.

You need to give specific detail for [footwear](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/classifying-footwear#further-information), [food](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/classifying-edible-vegetables-roots-and-tubers#further-information), [chemicals](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/classifying-organic-chemicals#further-information), [textiles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/classifying-textile-apparel#further-information) and [vehicles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/classifying-vehicles#further-information).

If you need advice about more than one product, send a separate email.

###Apply for a classification ruling

You can apply for a Binding Tariff Information (BTI) ruling to give certainty about the correct classification and how much duty you'll need to pay when importing your goods into the EU.

BTIs are:

- legally binding throughout the EU for 3 years
- free, but you may have to pay costs (for example, for laboratory analysis or expert advice)

You apply for a ruling using the eBTI online service.

s1. You’ll need an EORI number - how you get one depends on whether you're [registered for VAT](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) or not registered for VAT. Forms for [importers](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORINonVATImport?dept-name=&sub-dept-name=&location=43&origin=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk) and [exporters](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/EORIVAT) are available for those not registered.
s2. Sign up to use eBTI on the [Government Gateway website.](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/)
